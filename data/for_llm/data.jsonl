Traditional studies including theoretical model-based, empirical study-based and simulation-based methods encounter limitations due to the idealized assumption of complete information and individual rationality, as well as constraints posed by limited available data. In this work, we propose an innovative framework, SRAP-Agent (Simulating and Optimizing Scarce Resource Allocation Policy with LLM-based Agent), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into economic simulations, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world dynamics. Using public housing allocation scenarios as a case study, we conduct extensive policy simulation experiments to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the SRAP-Agent and employ the Policy Optimization Algorithm with certain optimization objectives.

This has led to a debate in recent years, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. This research aims to analyze the two sentiments of the public regarding the vaccination policy. This would be helpful to ensure the acceptance of the government campaign about vaccination. The data used was text data obtained from Twitter when Indonesia was facing the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The data were pre-processed by removing noise data, case folding, stemming, and tokenizing. Then, the data were classified with random forest, Naïve Bayes, and XGBoost. The results showed that all classifiers exhibit satisfying performance but XGBoost performs slightly better in accuracy value. This method can be deployed to be an automatic sentiment analyzer to help the government understand public feedback about its policies. This would be given by proper pre-processing and enough datasets. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Recent research has proposed the use of a large language model (LLM) to generate reward functions in reinforcement learning, thereby replacing the need for manually designed rewards by experts. However, this approach, which relies on textual descriptions to define learning objectives, fails to achieve controllable and precise behavior learning with clear directionality. In this paper, we introduce a new video2reward method, which directly generates reward functions from videos depicting the behaviors to be mimicked and learned. Specifically, we first process videos containing the target behaviors, converting the motion information of individuals in the videos into keypoint trajectories represented as coordinates through a video2text transforming module. These trajectories are then fed into an LLM to generate the reward function, which in turn is used to train the policy. To enhance the quality of the reward function, we develop a video-assisted iterative reward refinement scheme that visually assesses the learned behaviors and provides textual feedback to the LLM. This feedback guides the LLM to continually refine the reward function, ultimately facilitating more efficient behavior learning. Experimental results on tasks involving bipedal and quadrupedal robot motion control demonstrate that our method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art LLM-based reward generation methods by over 37.6% in terms of human normalized score. More importantly, by switching video inputs, we find our method can rapidly learn diverse motion behaviors such as walking and running. © 2024 The Authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Accordingly, we collected and analyzed 2230 policy documents spanning 25 years to track the Chinese government’s focus on the electric power sector over time using latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling. Our results reveal that the government’s area of emphasis differs across different stages of development. By analyzing the evolution of policy implementation, we identified the actions taken by government agencies at the policy level to promote the electric power industry. We then distilled the key themes of government attention and challenges facing the green transition of electricity in the context of “dual carbon”. Based on this analysis, we propose practical recommendations for restructuring power energy, enhancing power security, and improving power market efficiency. These findings hold important implications for China to achieve an environmentally sustainable electric power transformation. © 2023 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Some districts that have catered to tourism and commercial real estate have undergone architectural and lifestyle changes, thus resulting in the loss of folk culture. Additionally, as a result of funding shortages or property disputes, other districts appear to have decayed but have regained attention, as the collective memory of these districts is valued. This paper uses Shiqiao Town in Chengdu, China, as a case study to explore the redevelopment of historic districts, with a focus on preserving and revitalising collective memory during urban expansion. Via participant observations, semistructured interviews, netnography, natural language processing, and policy content reviews, this paper investigated collective memories based on the everyday lives and public perceptions of residents, with the aim of facilitating interactions between social groups, historic districts, and the city. Unlike previous practices related to creative destruction, current redevelopment practices offer opportunities for physical preservation and the representation of collective memory, thereby attaining a mutually beneficial outcome for both economic development and heritage conservation. The goal of this initiative is to promote the continuous reconstruction of collective memory, thus forming a redevelopment framework focused on ‘Original Memories’, ‘Stable Linkages’, and ‘Continuous Reconstruction’. This study also highlights potential issues in delayed redevelopment, such as authenticity, accuracy of cultural promotion, and resident participation, thereby offering insights for future development and similar historic districts. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The reason is its limitations in adapting the dynamically changing information of users, tasks, access policies and resources in such applications. It also does not incorporate semantically meaningful business roles, which could have a diverse impact upon access decisions in such multi-domain collaborative business environments. We propose an Intelligent Role-based Access Control (I-RBAC) model that uses intelligent software agents for achieving intelligent access control in such highly dynamic multi-domain environments. The novelty of this model lies in using a core I-RBAC ontology that is developed using real-world semantic business roles as occupational roles provided by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), USA. It contains around 1400 business roles, from nearly all domains, along with their detailed task descriptions as well as hierarchical relationships among them. The semantic role mining process is performed through intelligent agents that use word embedding and a bidirectional LSTM deep neural network for automated population of organizational ontology from its unstructured text policy and, subsequently, matching this ontology with core I-RBAC ontology to extract unified business roles. The experimentation was performed on a large number of collaboration case scenarios of five multi-domain organizations and promising results were obtained regarding the accuracy of automatically derived RDF triples (Subject, Predicate, Object) from organizational text policies as well as the accuracy of extracted semantically meaningful roles. © 2021 by the authors.

It represents the collective opinion and prevalent views about a certain topic, policy, or issue. Extreme public opinion consists of extreme views held by individuals that advocate and spread radical ideas for the purpose of radicalizing others. while the proliferation of social media gives unprecedented reach and visibility and a platform for freely expressing public opinion, social media fora can also be used for spreading extreme views, manipulating public opinions, and radicalizing others. In this work, we leverage data mining and analytics techniques to study extreme public opinion expressed using social medial. A dataset of 259, 904 tweets posted between 21/02/2016 and 01/05/2021 was collected in relation to extreme nationalism, hate speech, and supremacy. The collected data was analyzed using a variety to techniques, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, social circle analysis, and opinion leaders' identification, and results related to an American politician and an American right-wing activist were presented. The results obtained are very promising and open the door to the ability to monitor the evolution of extreme views and public opinion online. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

One application has several reviews from positive and negative users. Review data can be labeled with two types of emotions: negative sentiment and positive sentiment. Fine-grained sentiment analysis is a type of sentiment analysis that can be used to identify user reactions. One method of sentiment analysis is Multinomial Naïve Bayes. In this research, we used Multinomial Naïve Bayes to perform fine-grained sentiment analysis for users of the PeduliLindungi application. The data used is from the Google Play store. The sentiment class labeling results for the PeduliLindungi review data resulted in 9021 reviews, including a total of 6244 negative reviews and 2777 positive reviews. This research uses a data-sharing model that divides 80% of training data and 20% of test data. Many data imbalances for the two sentiment classes can be overcome by using the SMOTE method. SMOTE has been shown to improve classification accuracy more effectively than non-SMOTE, as applying SMOTE has been shown to improve the performance of imbalanced data. The proper classification method used to classify PeduliLindungi's user ratings is Multinomial Naïve Bayes-SMOTE, which has the highest AUC value.  © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science (IAES).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, using natural language processing techniques in data science domain, we analyzed twitter micro-blogging streams to detect emotions and sentiments that surround the Global youth Climate Protest (GloClimePro) with respect to #ThisIsZeroHour, #ClimateJustice and #WeDontHaveTime hashtags. The analysis follows tweet scrapping, cleaning and preprocessing, extraction of GloClimePro-related items, sentiment analysis, emotion classification, and visualization. The results obtained reveal that most people expressed joy, anticipation and trust emotions in the #ThisIsZeroHour and #ClimateJustice action than the few who expressed disgust, sadness and surprise. #ClimateJustice conveys the most positive sentiments, followed by #ThisIsZeroHour and the #WeDontHaveTime. In all the evaluations, a considerable number of people express fear in the climate action and consequences. Thus, climate change stakeholders and policy makers should consider the sentiments and emotions expressed by people and incorporate such outcomes in their various programmes toward addressing the climate change challenges especially as it affects the ecosystem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

CiteOpinion uses a deep learning model to automatically extract citing sentences from representative citing papers; it starts with an analysis on the citing sentences, then it identifies major academic contribution points of the cited paper, positive/negative evaluations from citing authors and the changes in the subjects of subsequent citing authors by means of Recognizing Categories of Moves (problems, methods, conclusions, etc.), and sentiment analysis and topic clustering. Citing sentences in a citing paper contain substantial evidences useful for academic evaluation. They can also be used to objectively and authentically reveal the nature and degree of contribution of the cited paper reflected by citation, beyond simple citation statistics. The evidence-based evaluation tool CiteOpinion can provide an objective and in-depth academic value evaluation basis for the representative papers of scientific researchers, research teams, and institutions. No other similar practical tool is found in papers retrieved. There are difficulties in acquiring full text of citing papers. There is a need to refine the calculation based on the sentiment scores of citing sentences. Currently, the tool is only used for academic contribution evaluation, while its value in policy studies, technical application, and promotion of science is not yet tested. © 2019 2019 Xiaoqiu Le, Jingdan Chu, Siyi Deng, Qihang Jiao, Jingjing Pei, Liya Zhu, Junliang Yao, published by Sciendo.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, it is unclear if the public shares these concerns. This study aimed to describe posts related to gabapentinoids, conduct a content analysis to identify common themes and describe adverse events or symptoms. Methods: Keywords of ‘pregabalin’ or ‘Lyrica’ or ‘gabapentin’ or ‘Neurontin’ were used to search for related tweets posted by people in the community between 8 March and 7 May 2021. Eligible tweets included a keyword in the post. We extracted de-identified data which included descriptive data of the total number of posts over time; and data on individual tweets including date, number of re-tweets and post content. Data were exported separately for pregabalin- and gabapentin-related tweets. A 20% random sample was used for the thematic analysis. Results: There were 2931 pregabalin-related tweets and 2736 gabapentin-related tweets. Thematic analysis revealed three themes (sharing positive experiences and benefits of taking gabapentinoids, people voicing their negative experiences, and people seeking opinions and sharing information). Positive experiences of gabapentinoids were related to sharing stories and giving advice. This was contrasted to negative experiences including ineffectiveness, withdrawals, side effects and frustration related to cost and insurance coverage. Brain fog was the most common adverse symptom reported. Gabapentinoid-related deaths were only mentioned in three tweets. Discussion: The increasing public health concern of gabapentinoid-related deaths was not translated to Twitter discussions. © 2022 The Authors.

We consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings-offline, online, and hybrid-and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.

This study uses text mining and machine learning methods for automatically identify and classify the topics that permeate a collection of documents. The topics of SSC research were identified, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, from 684 articles published between 2001 and 2017 in 13 top journals. Then, we explored trends by examining changes in the classification of topics in different periods and by identifying the hot and cold topics of SSC research. The relationships of these topics with the journals were also determined. Finally, applying the Competitive Neural Network learning model, the topics were classified according to the Elkington's Triple Bottom Line precepts. The findings of this study are expected to provide clues for researchers and policymakers in the field of SSC. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Key topics included alumni engagement, and the relatively low number of trainees interested in an academic career path. Dr. Dawn Beraud, the Executive Director of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) emphasized the importance of science advocacy, including increasing science funding and linking evidence-based decision making to policy. Discussions about graduate education highlighted best practices in using large language models, financial support challenges, and the significant role of industrial professionals in teaching. The proposed NextProf PharmSci program was discussed, which aims to address the imbalance of trainees leaning towards industry by preparing them for academic roles through a multi-day workshop. Participants expressed strong support for this initiative, emphasizing the need for a training pipeline and mentoring junior faculty. Participants agreed the event should be held annually, as it was found to be useful, and discussed future topics including sharing graduate and PharmD curricula as well as a shared summer school program. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To explain this puzzle, the article advances propositions regarding the role of multidimensional policy ideas, policy anomalies and institutional gatekeepers in legislative agenda-setting. Using structural topic modelling and qualitative methods, the analyses demonstrate that differences in action frames follow from agenda-setting institutions. The corporate structure of the European Commission ensures that EU agenda-setters are reasonably attentive to policy anomalies. By contrast, individuals with agenda-setting authority in the US Congress are liable to discount anomalies by limiting their focus to certain aspects of multidimensional policy issues. Moreover, individuals with gatekeeping authority may prevent repeal bills from accessing the legislative agenda. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While most studies focus on the design and development of chatbots, there exists a very scarce literature on the effect of ChatGPT chatbot on students’ achievement. To address this gap, this study checked the effect of ChatGPT chatbot on computer education students. Using a repeated measures approach, 68 year one undergraduates participated in the study. A 50-item Computer Education Achievement Test (CEAT), which was subjected to expert validation and pilot study, was used to obtain data. The students were given two pre-test and posttest measures before and after the treatment. Data were computed using mixed design repeated measures analysis of variance and the findings revealed that the use of ChatGPT chatbot improved students’ performance (F (3,201) = 408.793, P = 0.000) with an effect size (ηp2) of 0.859. The finding also revealed no significant moderating influence of gender, age and experience on the effect of ChatGPT chatbot on students’ performance. The study has some implication for lecturers, researchers and policy experts on the need to incorporate ChatGPT chatbot in education given that it has the potential to improve students’ performance and equally promote self-paced individualized learning. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While previous research has primarily considered how authoritarian regimes disseminate CTs for political purposes and has often viewed the public as fully receptive to propaganda and easily manipulated, our research explores a broader spectrum of state strategies including propagation, tolerance, and partial rebuttal. Based on social network analysis, topic modeling, and qualitative analysis of 46,387 Weibo posts from 3 cases, we argue that the Chinese government’s manipulation of CTs is multifaceted and carries significant audience costs. Our findings indicate that state-led CTs can indeed mobilize public opinion, but they also risk expanding beyond state control, which can lead to unintended consequences that may undermine state interests and limit policy flexibility. This research contributes to our understanding of the tactical and operational complexities authoritarian regimes face when leveraging CTs, while highlighting the intricate balance between state control and public agency. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We propose a novel taxonomy of three main classes based on the way that the two model types interact with each other. The first class, RL4LLM, includes studies where RL is leveraged to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). RL4LLM is divided into two sub-categories depending on whether RL is used to directly fine-tune an existing LLM or to improve the prompt of the LLM. In the second class, LLM4RL, an LLM assists the training of an RL model that performs a task that is not inherently related to natural language. We further break down LLM4RL based on the component of the RL training framework that the LLM assists or replaces, namely reward shaping, goal generation, and policy function. Finally, in the third class, RL+LLM, an LLM and an RL agent are embedded in a common planning framework without either of them contributing to training or fine-tuning of the other. We further branch this class to distinguish between studies with and without natural language feedback. We use this taxonomy to explore the motivations behind the synergy of LLMs and RL and explain the reasons for its success, while pinpointing potential shortcomings and areas where further research is needed, as well as alternative methodologies that serve the same goal. ©2024 The Authors.

Traditional questionnaires and interviews cannot fully and accurately reflect the attention and sentiments. Social media interactions can provide a new data-driven perspective to explore the sentiment toward EVs. This study uses data from public posts on Weibo to investigate intersectionality in EV - sentiment and attention as per user, gender and region. On a 1,149,243-text corpus extracted from the Weibo posts, a computational social science methodology was employed with a mixed-method of deep learning and topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. Results showed that attention toward EVs mainly comes from official users rather than individual users (IUs), and IUs' attention is closely linked with EV policy change. Additionally, the attention level and growth rate toward EVs vary across regions and men pay more attention to EVs. There exist significant differences in both positive and negative sentiment driving factors across genders. This study facilitates to EVs’ policy-making and strategy in China and other countries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In South Korea, rapid territorial changes have exposed personal-level issues, while current systems limited public engagement capabilities have constrained policymaking. Although efforts have been made to bridge this gap, they have been hindered by the lack of an effective medium. This study introduces a novel framework, PRiSm (Policy Recommendation Systems in Cadastral Survey), which leverages National Public Opinion Big Data. We collected and analyzed two key data sources: 1) public opinion data from 2018 to 2023, which correlates strongly with cadastral resurveys across South Korea, and 2) content from 54 major news media outlets over the same period. The first data set represents bottom-up opinions at the individual level, while the second reflects top-down perspectives on national issues. The PRiSm system, developed in this study, utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including Word2Vec and a Genetic Algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, to process over a thousand inquiries and news articles. Our results highlight how different groups engage in discussions shaped by their interests and concerns, revealing key sensitivities and recommending terms invaluable for stakeholders and policymakers. We anticipate that PRiSm will offer meaningful insights for the public and decision-makers. Additionally, with more advanced ML and/or Deep Learning algorithms, there is significant potential for further advancements in NLP within the PRiSm framework. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Alarmingly, numerous countries have seen a sharp increase in hate crimes driven by malicious hate campaigns. While the detection of hate speech has gained attention as a major research field, the complexities of its genesis and spread across online social networks remain largely unexamined. In this study, we focus on developing a benchmark dataset for hate and abusive speech, related to various aspects of Indian politics, and religious topics. The dataset comprises of a vast user base of politically active individuals, enabling us to capture the nuances of hate speech propagation within this context. Additionally, we employ advanced topic modeling techniques to analyze the data, uncovering the underlying themes and user reactions associated with the data. This detailed analysis reveals how people respond to these topics, the temporal activation of discussions, and the comparative trends between different hashtags. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers, social media companies, and researchers, helping them develop better strategies to reduce hate speech and promote positive online interactions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods: We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results: The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions: When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

Existing methods for identifying helpful reviews are based on the supervised learning paradigm. The capacity of supervised methods, however, is limited by the lack of annotated reviews. In addition, there is a serious distributional bias between the labeled and unlabeled reviews. Therefore, this paper proposes a reinforced semi-supervised neural learning method (abbreviated as RSSNL) for helpful review identification, which can automatically select high-related unlabeled reviews to help training. Concretely, RSSNL composes with a reinforced unlabeled review selection policy and a semi-supervised pseudo-labeling review classifier. These two parts train jointly and integrate together based on the policy gradient framework. Extensive experiments on Amazon product reviews verify the effectiveness of RSSNL for using unlabeled reviews. © 2020 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A comparative analysis of public statements and SNS posts by delegates to the United Nations\n                    ABSTRACT: Introduction: This article investigates the evolving landscape of diplomacy in the digital age, focusing on diplomats at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York. The central inquiry revolves around how diplomatic actors use digital tools to complement or augment traditional face-to-face diplomacy. Methods: We systematically compare a substantial corpus of X posts (tweets) from UN diplomats with their public statements at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), employing advanced computational social science techniques. This study applies a range of large-scale text analysis methods, including word embedding, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, to investigate systematic differences between offline and online communication. Results: Our analysis reveals that, while the essence of diplomacy remains consistent across both domains, there is strategic selectivity in the use of online platforms by diplomats. Online communication emphasizes non-security topics, ceremonial matters, and prominent policy stances, in contrast to the operational issues common in UNSC deliberations. Additionally, online discourse adopts a less confrontational, more public diplomacy-oriented tone, with variations among countries. Discussion: This study offers one of the first systematic comparisons between offline and online diplomatic messages. It illuminates how diplomats navigate the digital realm to complement traditional roles. The findings indicate that some elements of public diplomacy and nation branding, directed toward a wider audience far beyond the council chamber, have become an integral part of multilateral diplomacy unfolding at the UNSC.

Surprisingly, crashes involving vehicles with L2 driving automation contributed to the public's discussion of L3-L5 AVs. Understanding the variations in public perception of AVs is imperative, which could significantly affect the future evolution of AVs. Respondents have few opportunities to express their views freely in survey-based studies relying on structured questionnaires (e.g., Likert scale). We collected 42,111 comments from Chinese mainstream social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Tik Tok) in August 2021 and applied advanced text mining technology (Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, text network analysis, and sentiment analysis) to understand variations in public perception of AVs before and after the crashes. The results show that the public expresses more blame for vehicles with L2 driving automation than human drivers and has misunderstandings about the current development of L3-L5 AVs, which is closely connected with publicity from automobile companies and media. Women were more negative than men both before and after the crash, and the sentiment difference was most significant in the first three days of the crash. This research provides new ideas for a timely understanding of the public perception of AVs. Findings contribute to specific policy recommendations to help in the technological change and wider adoption of AVs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It identifies three phases where parts of the text of legislative acts can be developed: (1) agenda-setting; (2) intra-institutional decision-making and (3) interinstitutional negotiations, depending on whether the content of the legislation originates respectively in the Commission proposal, the co-legislators’ positions or trilogue negotiations. Using a newly developed text-mining technique which computes in which phase each word of a legislative act originally appears, the article examines the relative importance of each phase and explores how it is affected by interinstitutional conflict. Applying this method to 219 legislative acts adopted between 2012 and 2018, it finds that most EU legislation originates in the agenda-setting phase, and that the new content developed during trilogue negotiations is limited. However, the importance of the agenda-setting phase decreases in cases with high levels of interinstitutional conflict. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study delves into the integration of the metaverse in the tourism and education sectors in China, aiming to uncover the intricate dynamics of public perceptions and the educational potential of this digital innovation. This research utilizes semantic network and sentiment analysis of social media discussions on China’s Weibo platform to provide a detailed understanding of sentiments toward the metaverse’s impact on tourism education. Semantic Network Analysis explores the complex dialog surrounding the metaverse in the context of lifelong learning. The findings reveal a balanced mix of enthusiasm for the immersive educational opportunities afforded by the metaverse and concerns regarding data privacy, digital addiction, and ethical considerations. It is evident from this duality that a balanced approach is necessary when the metaverse is integrated into tourism and learning while being sensitive to technological opportunities and ethical challenges. The metaverse could be an immersive, interactive learning environment endorsed by modern educational theories, supporting active learning through experience. The metaverse will provide valuable assistance to tourism education, which will help enhance this field through the simulation of real tourism for students to learn, which will foster cultural understanding and meet the demands of a globalized tourism industry. It further recommends that policies and practices should be formulated to ensure equal access, respect for the privacy of every participant, and the ethical use of the technology. This study contributes to the analysis of the potentials and challenges of the metaverse in the tourism and learning industry. It highlights the metaverse as an ‘emerging tool for lifelong learning’ and offers insights into how educators, policymakers, and industry leaders, all aiming at the integration of digital innovations in education, should exploit the metaverse. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Software platforms aiming to support digital deliberation usually suffer from information overload, due to the large amount of feedback that is often provided. While Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques can alleviate this drawback, their complex structure discourages users from trusting their results. This paper proposes two Explainable Artificial Intelligence models to enhance transparency and trust in the modus operandi of the above techniques, which concern the processes of clustering and summarization of citizens’ feedback that has been uploaded on a digital deliberation platform. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study focuses on the context analysis of one of the megacities in China - Shenzhen, pointing out that migration was a key driver of Shenzhen’s development. And migration and industrialization led to a unique urbanization phenomenon: the ‘symbiosis’ of urban villages and industrial parks, where migrants live and work. However, it is argued that during an economic and social transition period, even though the migrants account for most of Shenzhen’s population, the risk of losing jobs and the unaffordable housing in Shenzhen, are expelling them. On the contrary, the migrants, as well as other early-stage starters in the city, are young and have the intention to improve themselves and promote their career. But the current urban renewal movement, targeting urban villages and industrial parks, does not take the inclusiveness of urban migrants into account is defined as the problem. To translate this social issue of inclusiveness into the spatial arena, arrival city theory is referred to and expanded to a wider discourse, emphasizing the importance of affordable work-related space for migrants and other career starters to promote their career in this specific context. Thus, the research topic on providing affordable work-related space is stated. In order to understand the relationship between socio-economic performativity and urban form, both mathematical analysis approach of space syntax by Hillier and descriptive disciplines suggested by Jacobs, Montgomery, Gehl and Lynch are referred to and verified in this context. As a result of verification, the positive relation between street integration and retailing performativity is revealed, as well as the importance of wide sidewalk, pedestrian-friendly street and attractive public space. The analysis of urban patterns through space syntax profiled the spatial structure and spatial qualities on a local scale, and based on these, planning principles were set for urban strategies in the future. © 2019 Beijing JiaoTong University.

Consequently, software requirements must conform to those privacy policies. To help stakeholders extract privacy goals from policies, we introduce a semiautomated framework that combines crowdworker annotations, natural language typed dependency parses, and a reusable lexicon to improve goal-extraction coverage, precision, and recall. The framework evaluation consists of a five-policy corpus governing web and mobile information systems, yielding an average precision of 0.73 and recall of 0.83. The results show that no single framework element alone is sufficient to extract goals; however, the overall framework compensates for elemental limitations. Human annotators are highly adaptive at discovering annotations in new texts, but those annotations can be inconsistent and incomplete; dependency parsers lack sophisticated, tacit knowledge, but they can perform exhaustive text search for prospective requirements indicators; and while the lexicon may never completely saturate, the lexicon terms can be reliably used to improve recall. Lexical reuse reduces false negatives by 41%, increasing the average recall to 0.85. Last, crowd workers were able to identify and remove false positives by around 80%, which improves average precision to 0.93. © 2016 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For institutions which are not directly elected by voters, such as the European Commission (EC), social media can be a strategic tool for increasing perceived legitimacy and citizen engagement, especially in contexts of high politicization. In this paper, we use natural language processing techniques to provide a comprehensive overview of how EC communication on Twitter has evolved between 2010 and 2022, with respect to both its topics and its style. Our analyses show that, over time, the focus of EC communication has shifted substantially from economy-, finance- and governance-related topics, towards social policy, digital and environmental policy, and identity. These changes have progressively differentiated the EC’s profile from that of other institutions (especially more technocratic ones) and contributed to better alignment with engagement patterns of its social media audience. In addition, EC communication has become less neutral (in favor of more positive sentiment), simpler, and more readable, all features which are associated with more accessible and engaging messaging. Yet, while the EC currently scores better than most other reference agencies on several descriptors of accessibility, its style is still lexically more complex, less concrete and less action-oriented than that of other institutions. Alongside providing novel insights on how the EC’s online communication and projected political identity have changed over time, this study lays the foundations for future experimental and hypothesis-driven work combining social media data with external data sources. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, based on the time stage, text mining technology and visualization are used to conduct an in-depth analysis of (2016–2023) Year China's agricultural cold chain logistics policy. Under the configuration of the Python 3.7 environment, a total of 21 theme words were extracted from three-time stages by (LDA), and the importance of each theme was visualized and analyzed using Enriched Difference and Chord Diagrams (ECD), to explore the evolutionary trend of the policies at different stages. It is found that at various stages of the development of cold chain logistics for agricultural products, the content of policies ranges from enterprise operation to industry construction to government assistance, and the nature of policies is gradually systematized and standardized. The results of this paper not only have a guiding effect on the theoretical improvement of the policy system of agricultural cold chain logistics and have important practical significance for the development of agricultural cold chain logistics in China. © 2025 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For three years we were involved in a U.S. National Science Foundation funded project designed to enhance the participation of citizens in government agency rulemaking processes using online public deliberation and Natural Language Processing technologies. Despite a promising approach in an important arena for direct and regular public engagement, the project was met with serious obstacles in trying to secure a partnership with a government agency or interest groups. This led us to consider the policy process literature for insights regarding the obstacles we faced. That literature, a mainstay in the public policy and public administration curriculum in the U.S. and an attempt to capture how policy makers actually make decisions, heavily focuses on institutional actors and their adversarial relationships. Yet, it provides for hardly any role for the public to participate in what ideally should be a democratic process. Important components of the literature imply that institutional actors should discourage direct public engagement. The analysis seeks to clarify leverage points and contexts that could be used to promote online public engagement as a regular component of government processes. © 2011-IOS Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using Twitter Application Program Interface (API), we collected the tweets containing the hashtags #CommonCore and #CCSS for 12 months from 2014 to 2015. A Common Core corpus was created by compiling all the collected 660,051 tweets. The results of sentiment analysis suggest Twitter users expressed overwhelmingly negative sentiment toward the CCSS in all 50 states. Five topic clusters were detected by cluster analysis of the hashtag co-occurrence network. We also found that most of the opinion leaders were those who expressed negative sentiment toward the CCSS on Twitter. This study for the first time demonstrates how text mining techniques can be applied to education policy research, laying the foundation for real-time analytics of public opinion on education policies, thereby informing policymaking and implementation. © The Author(s) 2017.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

During the last decade, several platforms and applications have been developed to store, process and analyse big and heterogeneous volumes of such data. Having thoroughly considered various techniques and approaches used to index, analyse and reason about these types of data, this paper proposes a hybrid knowledge graph and semantic-based approach for querying earth observation data sources. The proposed approach acts as a unified framework for diverse earth observation data sources, which does not only enhance data accessibility, but also enables the discovery of previously hidden knowledge and the extraction of meaningful insights. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This book explores current cybersecurity trends and effective software applications, AI, and decision-making processes to combat cyberattacks. It emphasizes the importance of compliance, provides downloadable digital forensics software, and examines the psychology of organizational practice for effective cybersecurity leadership. Since the year 2000, research consistently reports devasting results of ransomware and malware attacks impacting healthcare and higher education. These attacks are crippling the ability for these organizations to effectively protect their information systems, information technology, and cloud-based environments. Despite the global dissemination of knowledge, healthcare and higher education organizations continue wrestling to define strategies and methods to secure their information assets, understand methods of assessing qualified practitioners to fill the alarming number of opened positions to help improve how cybersecurity leadership is deployed, as well as improve workplace usage of technology tools without exposing these organizations to more severe and catastrophic cyber incidents. This practical book supports the reader with downloadable digital forensics software, teaches how to utilize this software, as well as correctly securing this software as a key method to improve usage and deployment of these software applications for effective cybersecurity leadership. Furthermore, readers will understand the psychology of industrial organizational practice as it correlates with cybersecurity leadership. This is required to improve management of workplace conflict, which often impedes personnel's ability to comply with cybersecurity law and policy, domestically and internationally. © 2025 River Publishers.

In this study, we investigate the issue of users' car parking behaviour through a comprehensive analysis of related hashtags collected from the Twitter social media platform. For this purpose, we adopted a two-step strategy where in the first stage, a surface-level analysis of the identified hashtags involving inductive reasoning, sentiment analysis, and user interaction in terms of engagement and diversity scores is performed. In the second phase, a tweet content analysis is performed using sentiment analysis and Empath categorization with respect to the most frequent wordings (assimilating to separate topics), in the same spirit as aspect-sentiment analysis, to gain further insights regarding the occurrence of negative and positive posts. A quantitative evaluation of the coherence of the Empath categorization indicates that achieved 0.83% coherence score and outperformed both LDA and LSA that had a score of 0.77% and 0.76% respectively. Furthermore, the common word technique assimilated to aspect sentiment compared to the state-of-the-art model for aspect sentiment-based deberta-v3-base model. Besides, the influence of bots or spammers is evaluated using engagement/diversity measures and Botometer API. The results provide valuable insights in terms of discriminating between positive and negative posts and the correlation of surface-level analysis with content-based analysis, as well as the impact of various categorizations. The results expect to enable urban planners and policymakers to advance evidence-based policing in the future design of intelligent parking systems. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper aims to analyze the key obstacles of prefabricated building extension systematically and propose corresponding countermeasures. Firstly, the obstacles of prefabricated components were sorted out by the web text mining technique combined with investigation and survey. Secondly, an analytical model was established based on the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method and the interpretive structural modeling (ISM). Thirdly, the intelligent algorithms were applied to solve the model, and the detailed discussion about quantification of the influence degree among obstacles, the identification of the key obstacles, and the causal mechanism analysis is conducted. Based on the calculation result, targeting countermeasures and policy recommendations are put forward to alleviate these obstacle factors. © 2022 ICCREM 2022: Carbon Peak and Neutrality Strategies of the Construction Industry - Proceedings of the International Conference on Construction and Real Estate Management 2022.

Evaluation of policy is an essential and vital process required to measure the performance or pro-gression of the scheme. The main purpose of policy evaluation is to empower various stakeholders and enhance their socio-economic environment. A large number of policies or schemes in different areas are launched/constituted by government in view of the citizen welfare. Although, the governmental policies intend to better shape up the quality of life of people but may also impact their eve-ryday's life. Objective: The contemplation of public opinion plays a very significant role in the process of policy evaluation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to incorporate the concept of opinion mining in policy evaluation. An attempt has been made to elevate the process of policy evaluation by analyzing public opinion. Methods: A latest governmental scheme Saubhagya launched by the Indian government in 2017 has been selected for evaluation by applying supervised learning based opinion mining techniques. The data set of public opinion associated with this scheme has been captured by Twitter. Results: The result validates that the proposed methodology supports the optimizing process of policy evaluation and provides a more accurate and actual status of policy's effect among Indian citizen. As a result, this would aid in identifying and implementing the preventive and corrective measures required to be taken for a successful policy. Conclusion: The proposed methodology will stabilize and strengthen the process of policy evaluation which target towards favourable and flourishing future prospects concerning the socio-economic status of a nation. The results are quite exciting and further extension of work will be performed in order to develop and design a patent framework in the area of social big data analytics. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Social media platforms provide open and large-scale data on how the public views NEVs. Accordingly, based on data collected from Sina Weibo, the largest open social media platform in China, this study adopts web crawler and text mining to explore public attitudes and sentiments toward NEVs. The results show that the majority of NEVs followers belong to the media and broadcasting unit, which may lead to exaggerated advertising of NEVs performance. Public pay more attention to NEVs in environmental pollution and developed economies regions than others. In addition, it is found that the public is generally concerned about driving range, policies, battery charging and safety performance, and NEVs-related attributes. Some interesting findings are that preferential policies such as unrestricted driving are more popular with the public than tax incentives, and the public attaches a high degree of importance to the brand in the attributes of NEVs. Moreover, the Chinese public has relatively positive sentiments on NEVs, mainly due to the impact of China's carbon reduction targets. Negative sentiments are mainly due to safety and battery technology issues. Finally, some policy implications derived from the discussion are given. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

DoDAF is the basis for integrated architectures and provides broad levels of specification related to operational, system, and technical views. In our earlier work, we described an approach to support specification of DoDAF architectures within a development environment based on DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) for semi-automated construction of the needed simulation models. The result is an enhanced system lifecycle development process that includes both development and testing in an integral manner. We also developed automated model generation using XML which paves the way for OVs to become service-providing components in the Web Services architecture. In this paper we present the semantic structure for one of the Operational View documents OV-6a that would aid the development of these semi-automated models. We will describe how OV-6a can be structured in a more generalized meta-model framework such that every rule is reducible to meaningful code which is automatedly constructed through Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and further be reduced to DEVS based models. The paper also presents an overview of the Life-cycle development methodology for these enterprise architectures and how a common enterprise domain-model can be used in customized business/domain-specific rules and policy structures. © 2006 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, many existing studies are limited in suggesting management plans that fit the characteristics of different age groups of people visiting national parks. Therefore, this study aims to identify the requirements for national parks and set the direction for national park services by age group. Methods: This study collected the requirements for national parks from 902 people of different ages through an online self-administered questionnaire and analyzed them through semantic link network analysis. Results: As a result of the analysis, there were management requirements in two areas related to the environment (rubbish and ecological environment, facilities environment such as safety and forest fires) and one area related to the economy, and a monitoring system for rubbish and ecological environment and a private land management policy for the economy were identified as alternatives. The younger generation was interested in environmental issues, the older generation was interested in economic issues, and the elderly was interested in the facilities environment for safety and forest fires. Therefore, it was found that environmental campaigns should be conducted for the younger generation, admission fees and parking rates should be improved for the older generation, and a safe tour environment should be provided for the elderly. Conclusion: The needs analysis found that it is necessary to establish a monitoring system for all national parks from an environmental perspective and improve the management policy about private land from an economic perspective. Furthermore, environmental campaigns and events were required for the younger generation, benefits related to entrance fees for the elderly, and policies to create a safe facilities environment for the elderly. Establishing such national park policies will improve the satisfaction of users. © 2023 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

North Korea made many attempts using these nuclear weapons. In September 2017, North Korea succeeded the sixth nuclear test and launched a missile in November 2017. In May 2017 South Korea attacked by Ransomware which is Wannacry. The possibility of North Korea’s execution was suggested. They provoke not only in physical space but also in cyber space. North Korea’s attack is getting sophisticated in cyber-attack. In addition, North Korea’s prestige is getting higher in cyberspace because only they possess nuclear weapon. The reason is that when North Korea conducted a nuclear test, almost all the world news broadcast about North Korea's nuclear test. In the cyberspace the articles or SNS, people call North Korea is the most dangerous and threat nation. If North Korea intimidates information about nuclear weapons and missiles through cyber space, the possibility of social turmoil may increase through weapons that have never actually been seen. Currently the target is South Korea but when this social turmoil increased the target will spread to all over the world. In order to prevent such social turmoil, this study identifies the symbolic meaning of nuclear weapon in cyber space. To find the meaning this paper uses the recent nuclear test of North Korea and measures the risk through SNS(Social Network Service) and online articles. To measure the risk, in this research use the FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) model which it can analyzes risk by factors. In this paper propose countermeasure policy against cyber psychological warfare through final risk. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc.

However, their adoption in government remains limited, and harnessing their benefits while preventing unintended consequences remains a challenge. While prior work has focused on improving NLP performance, this work examines how different internal government stakeholders influence NLP tools' thoughtful adoption. We interviewed seven politicians (politically appointed officials as heads of government institutions) and thirteen public servants (career government employees who design and administrate policy interventions), inquiring how they choose whether and how to use NLP tools to support civic participation processes. The interviews suggest that policymakers across both groups focused on their needs for career advancement and the need to showcase the legitimacy and fairness of their work when considering NLP tool adoption and use. Because these needs vary between politicians and public servants, their preferred NLP features and tool designs also differ. Interestingly, despite their differing needs and opinions, neither group clearly identifies who should advocate for NLP adoption to enhance civic participation or address the unintended consequences of a poorly considered adoption. This lack of clarity in responsibility might have caused the governments' low adoption of NLP tools. We discuss how these findings reveal new insights for future HCI research. They inform the design of NLP tools for increasing civic participation efficiency and capacity, the design of other tools and methods that ensure thoughtful adoption of AI tools in government, and the design of NLP tools for collaborative use among users with different incentives and needs.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this context, discussion on spent nuclear fuel is a prerequisite to expanding nuclear energy, as it leads to the issue of radioactive waste disposal. Given the dearth of study on spent nuclear fuel public acceptance, we use text mining and big data analysis on the news article and public comments data on Naver news portal to identify the Korean public opinion on spent nuclear fuel. We identify that the Korean public is more interested in the nuclear energy policy than spent nuclear fuel itself and that the alternative energy sources affect the position towards spent nuclear fuel. We recommend relating spent nuclear fuel issue with nuclear energy policy and environmental issues of alternative energy sources to further promote spent nuclear fuel. © 2022 Korean Nuclear Society\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge about structure of co-commenting. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a dataset of 17,386 full text posts written by top 2,000 LiveJournal bloggers and over 520,000 comments that result in about 4.5 million edges in the network of co-commenting, where posts are vertices. The Louvain algorithm is used to detect communities of co-commenting. Cosine similarity and topic modeling based on latent Dirichlet allocation are applied to study topical coherence within these communities. Findings – Bloggers unite into moderately manifest communities by commenting roughly the same sets of posts. The graph of co-commenting is sparse and connected by a minority of active non-top commenters. Communities are centered mainly around blog authors as opinion leaders and, to a lesser extent, around a shared topic or topics. Research limitations/implications – The research has to be replicated on other datasets with more thorough hand coding to ensure the reliability of results and to reveal average proportions of topic-centered communities. Practical implications – Knowledge about factors around which co-commenting communities emerge, in particular clustered opinion leaders that often attract such communities, can be used by policy makers in marketing and/or political campaigning when individual leadership is not enough or not applicable. Originality/value – The research contributes to the social studies of online communities. It is the first study of communities based on co-commenting that combines examination of the content of commented posts and their topics. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Often, policymakers and tech industry players invoke artificial intelligence as the solution to complex challenges around online content, promising that AI is a scant few years away from resolving everything from hate speech to harassment to the spread of terrorist propaganda. Missing from these promises, however, is an acknowledgement that proactive identification and automated removal of user-generated content raises problems beyond issues of “accuracy” and overbreadth--problems that will not be solved with more sophisticated AI. In this commentary, I discuss how the technical realities of content filtering stack up against the protections for freedom of expression in international human rights law. As policymakers and companies around the world turn to AI for communications governance, it is crucial that we recall why legal protections for speech have included presumptions against prior censorship, and consider carefully how proactive content moderation will fundamentally re-shape the relationship between rules, people, and their speech. © The Author(s) 2020.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In addition, this study seeks to examine the characteristics of the messages, content, and engagement rates of the information which has been published by the four central government bodies responsible for the management of the emerging crisis in Israel. This article is based on content analysis to examine the work of four main government ministries on Facebook (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance) throughout the first six months of the crisis from February to July 2020. Findings indicate that The Ministry of Health's posts yielded the highest engagement rates compared to the rest of the ministries. Also, we categorized the posts into four main categories: Policy, Advocacy & COVID-19 additional information, Restrictions, Guidelines & Recommendations. In terms of Sentiment analysis, posts containing restrictions have created the highest emotional reactions (positive and negative). Research findings can be deduced regarding modes of distribution in terms of messages, publication dates, and types of content to improve users' responses in terms of audience engagement and sentiment. © 2023 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this study, we propose to explicitly incorporate the query costs in the static caching policy. To this end, a query's cost is represented by its execution time, which involves CPU time to decompress the postings and compute the query-document similarities to obtain the final top-N answers. Simulation results using a large Web crawl data and a real query log reveal that the proposed strategy improves overall system performance in terms of the total query execution time. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The present study aims to analyze the global research topics in information science and library science, while also reviewing research topics from previous years and identifying thematic gaps. This analysis will provide a foundation for planning and policy research in this field. Methodology: The present study utilized an automated classification technique. Data analysis was performed on 85,403 articles indexed on the Web of Science website between 1945 and 2019 in the field of library and information science. The source and tool used for extracting research data was Web of Science. After preparing and pre-processing the data and formulating the classification plan for articles across 31 thematic categories, the logistic regression algorithm has been employed for the automatic classification of articles. This algorithm assigns articles to their respective thematic categories using the Cosine similarity criterion. The various stages of the research were performed using the Python 3.7 programming language and the Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, and Plotly software packages. Findings: Most of the global research in this field is dedicated to information technology, while the field of organizational management has the least amount of research. The growth trend of research in many thematic areas is increasing. However, there is further growth in areas such as web studies, information technology, information behavior, user studies, in formation retrieval, and search engines. After the 1990s, popular terms such as social media, big data, virtual library, IoT (Internet of Things), machine learning, deep learning, data mining, open data, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, cloud computing, virtual reality, augmented reality, and machine translation have emerged in research in this field. It appears that the utilization of keywords pertaining to traditional subjects in the field has declined, while the usage of concepts encompassing new topics related to technology and the web has increased. The rapid growth of fields such as web development, technology, artificial intelligence, and data mining has led to the evolution of research topics and increased connections with computer science and information technology, particularly in recent years. The changes in the subjects of this field can be attributed to the development of the web and advancements in technology. Additionally, the concepts and research topics in this field have had an impact on globalization, communication progress, and overall development in various economic, social, and cultural dimensions. Conclusion: The conclusion of the study highlights the thematic trends in library and information science research over different time periods. It also identifies the weaknesses in the scientific output of this field, while outlining the evolutionary process and the path of progress and development in the field of science. Due to the fact that scientific outputs are derived from the issues, needs, and priorities of a society at any given time, studying them can help clarify the most important issues and research needs in the field of library and information science. This, in turn, can provide a foundation for identifying future research needs and subjects in the field. In other words, having a clear understanding of the subject areas of library and information science will help researchers in this field identify the most important issues and needs. This, in turn, will enable them to take appropriate actions when selecting topics for future research. By conducting needs-based research, we can lay the groundwork for policy development and research planning in this field. This approach will also help address potential challenges and problems that may arise. This is despite the fact that if the needs and issues are ignored, research resources and credits will be spent on topics that do not have the necessary priority and importance. It cannot be expected that the findings from these topics will solve the problems and pave the way for the advancement of this field. © 2023, Shahed University.

Despite the significant rise in women entrepreneurship, challenges persist, including gender-based barriers, limited access to capital, and regional disparities. Understanding these dynamics is essential for formulating policies that support and empower women entrepreneurs. Method: The present study employed a systematic literature review (SLR) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an advanced topic modeling technique, to identify prevalent themes within the literature. Data was extracted from Scopus-indexed journals (2000–2024), systematically filtered, and analyzed to uncover key patterns in women entrepreneurship research. Results: The analysis identifies four central themes: (1) Women in Entrepreneurship and Gender Roles, (2) Small Business and Women Enterprises, (3) Social Impact of Women Entrepreneurs, and (4) Challenges Faced by Female Entrepreneurs. The findings highlight the transformative potential of digital platforms in enhancing business opportunities for women and addressing traditional constraints, such as mobility and market access. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to enhance digital literacy, bridge socio-cultural disparities, and establishing inclusive policies that foster a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem. By synthesizing existing literature, this research provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, financial institutions, and stakeholders to strengthen women-led enterprises and drive gender-equitable growth.

Challenges and risks of bias in large language models\n                    ABSTRACT: As generative language models, exemplified by ChatGPT, continue to advance in their capabilities, the spotlight on biases inherent in these models intensifies. This paper delves into the distinctive challenges and risks associated with biases specifically in large-scale language models. We explore the origins of biases, stemming from factors such as training data, model specifications, algorithmic constraints, product design, and policy decisions. Our examination extends to the ethical implications arising from the unintended consequences of biased model outputs. In addition, we analyze the intricacies of mitigating biases, acknowledging the inevitable persistence of some biases, and consider the consequences of deploying these models across diverse applications, including virtual assistants, content generation, and chatbots. Finally, we provide an overview of current approaches for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating biases in language models, underscoring the need for a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort to craft AI systems that embody equity, transparency, and responsibility. This article aims to catalyze a thoughtful discourse within the AI community, prompting researchers and developers to consider the unique role of biases in the domain of generative language models and the ongoing quest for ethical AI. © This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Discussing the relation between SNS and open innovation\n                    ABSTRACT: The millennial generation plays a leading role in today's connected world in which exists a confluence of numerous technologies and the internet in science, economy and innovation. This study aimed to identify the key factors that characterize the millennial generation within the online chatter on Twitter using an innovative approach. To this end, we analyzed the user generated content (UGC) in the social network (SNS) Twitter using a three-steps knowledge-based method for information management. In order to develop this method, we first used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a state-of-the-art thematic modeling tool that works with Python, to analyze topics in our database. The data were collected by extracting tweets with the hashtag #Millennial, #Millennials and #MillennialGeneration on Twitter (n = 35,401 tweets). Secondly, sentiment analysis with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was also developed using machine-learning. Applying this method to the LDA results resulted in the categorization of the topics into those that contained negative, positive and neutral sentiments. Thirdly, in order to gather the final results, data text mining techniques were used. The negative factors that characterize the behavior of this generation are depression, loneliness and real-world relationship. The positive factors are body image, self-expression, travelers and digital life and the neutral factors are self-identity and anxiety. Practical implications can be used by public actors, companies or policy makers that are focused on the millennial generation as a target. The study has important theoretical applications as the topics discovered can be used to test quantitative models based on the findings and insights extracted from the UGC sample. © 2019 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While being a powerful algorithm, their work has focused on computer vision tasks, where it is comparatively easy to apply imperceptible perturbations without changing an image's semantic meaning. In our work, we adapt AutoAugment to automatically discover effective perturbation policies for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as dialogue generation. We start with a pool of atomic operations that apply subtle semantic-preserving perturbations to the source inputs of a dialogue task (e.g., different POS-tag types of stopword dropout, grammatical errors, and paraphrasing). Next, we allow the controller to learn more complex augmentation policies by searching over the space of the various combinations of these atomic operations. Moreover, we also explore conditioning the controller on the source inputs of the target task, since certain strategies may not apply to inputs that do not contain that strategy's required linguistic features. Empirically, we demonstrate that both our input-agnostic and input-aware controllers discover useful data augmentation policies, and achieve significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art, including trained on manually-designed policies. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It is gradually being introduced to support new forms of research, discovery, and reuse of library contents in advanced and interesting ways. University libraries have the potential to substantially improve their library services through the implementation of sophisticated AI tools. This study explored the application of AI tools in the university libraries of Pakistan, as well as draw a comparison in the usage of AI tools between public and private sector universities. This is a quantitative study and data is collected through survey methodology. We used purposive sampling to collect the data from 175 university libraries. The collected data was analyzed using a statistical package for social sciences (SPSS-version 22). Findings indicate that while AI-based services are starting to be introduced into university libraries in Pakistan, no university library has implemented the full suite of AI-based tools. Natural language processing, voice searching, and chatbots are the most familiar and popular tools currently used in libraries. However, robotics technology is rarely used with a mean value of (1.62) because of the financial investment and high level of IT skills required. We found that private university libraries are using AI tools more as compared with public sector university libraries. The study concludes with several key recommendations, including closer collaboration between the library and the respective university IT department for technical support and assistance; improved financial support and ICT infrastructure to establish AI technology-based library services; and training development plans for library staff. Insights gained from this study should contribute to the capacity of Pakistani University librarians and their staff to maximize the full potential of AI within their institutions. The research implications are helpful to library leaders and policymakers in building a policy for AI-based technology in their respective university libraries. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These resources may or may not be educational. However, they can be harnessed for educational purposes by adapting and personalizing them to different learner needs. We propose to collaboratively annotate learning resources with a lightweight resource annotation metadata schema complemented by a folksonomy-derived semantic model. The annotation metadata schema follows a novel policy to associate numerical ratings to learners’ subjective expression of opinions on learning resources. On the other hand, the semantic model serves to support a collaborative resource recommendation algorithm based on the k-nearest neighbour approach. Proof-of-concept is demonstrated via a prototype Web-based recommender. Preliminary results indicate learners are confident with the recommended learning resources in terms of accuracy, usefulness, novelty and information adequacy. Formalization of folksonomy in annotating learning resources as well as in opinion mining from the crowd to rate resources may not only support personalization but also engage learners more effectively in technology-enhanced learning. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In Korea, in response to COVID-19, the COVID-19 vaccine approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety was sequentially administered to each group, raising national interest in the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of the vaccine, and securing the basis for related policies. Many attempts have been made for this. We are interested in a methodology to establish a scientific basis for how to respond to issues regarding vaccine stability due to the emergence of new infectious diseases. In this study, we use comments posted on Naver, the largest social platform in Korea, to obtain consumer sentiment information about vaccines and understand the change in Korean public sentiment in the first half of 2021 for each vaccine based on the analysis pipeline (SNSMiner_VAC). We investigated the Korean public's response to the COVID-19 vaccination on social media from November 30, 2021, to January 31, 2022. We collected comments related to the COVID-19 vaccination using the Korean words for “COVID-19 vaccination” as keywords. Of the 329,559 comments, 240,322 were analyzed after preprocessing. We developed three lexicons (stopwords, sentiment words, and custom words related to COVID-19) for Korean natural language processing. Furthermore, we extracted five clusters — including symptoms, side effects, vaccine hesitancy, pro-vaccination, and infectious disease control policy — through network analysis. The sentiment analysis revealed that negative public opinion was prominent even after the commencement of the phased recovery of daily life. From these results, we were able to automatically collect data-based information on patients’ symptoms and side effects for the new vaccine and prepare and analyze the basis for collecting public opinions about vaccination. We hope that the pipeline proposed in this study can be used as a tool to create a data source for effective management policies for vaccines being developed against the emergence of new infectious diseases. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative combat of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, incorporating large language model(LLM) into the process of aircraft pilots commanding and controlling multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The framework utilizes LLM for complex semantic understanding and monitoring of task instruction execution. It allows pilots to issue task instructions to UAVs using non-standard natural language. The received natural language task instructions are matched with the preloaded policy library of the designed task executor in UAVs, and an appropriate policy is selected for execution. During task execution, UAVs provide feedback on the task execution status to manned aircraft at key nodes, and continue task execution upon confirmation by manned aircraft until task completion or receipt of new task instructions. The framework is tested in typical beyond-visual-range combat scenarios of manned and unmanned aerial vehicle collaboration. It exhibits good human-machine interaction, robustness, trustworthiness, explainability, and effectively reducing the decision-making and operational burdens on pilots. The research findings of this paper can be widely applied to various task scenarios where humans and robots collaborate to accomplish tasks, providing a feasible technical route for the collaborative combat of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2024, International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences.

A study examining a case of rapid public health policy adaptation in China during the COVID-19 epidemic was conducted by gathering public opinion data from major social media platforms. A systematic approach to comprehend public opinion was developed. Five fundamental elements and four dimensions were delineated. An indicator system was established utilizing the K-means text clustering model. Public prediction, expectation, and their evolution underlying public concern were elucidated employing TF–IDF text mining models. The HMM elucidated the way public opinion influences policy adjustments. The findings underscore that public concern regarding enduring events undergoes temporal shifts, mirroring the evolution of public opinion towards policy. Public opinion aroused by both the original event and derived events collaboratively influence policy adjustments. In China, public opinion serves as a mechanism for policy feedback and oversight; notably, negative public sentiment plays a pivotal role in expediting policy transitions. These findings aid in refining policies to mitigate emergencies through a feedback loop, thereby averting the emergence of safety risks such as social unrest prompted by public opinion. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

After more than half a century of development and boom, these cities are starting to decline and industrial transformation is urgently needed. This paper focuses on evaluating the transformation capability of resource-based cities building an evaluation model. Using Text Mining and the Document Explorer technique as a way of extracting text features, the 200 most frequently used words are derived from 100 publications related to steel- and other resource-based cities. The Expert Evaluation Method (EEM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques are then applied to select 53 indicators, determine their weights and establish an index system for evaluating the transformation capability of the pillar industry of China's steel-based cities. Using real data and expert reviews, the improved Fuzzy Relation Matrix (FRM) method is applied to two case studies in China, namely Panzhihua and Daye, and the evaluation model is developed using Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE). The cities' abilities to carry out industrial transformation are evaluated with concerns expressed for the case of Daye. The findings have policy implications for the potential and required industrial transformation in the two selected cities and other resource-based towns. © 2015 Li et al.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using machine learning and text mining analyses, combined with qualitative narrative analysis, the study examines 53,441 news articles from 17 US, Mexican and Northern Triangle media outlets from 1999 to 2019, tracing and critiquing the shifts in coverage. Findings suggest that all three media systems generally align in their depiction of the scene, key agents and acts regarding migration; however, US narratives increasingly diverge from Northern Triangle and Mexican narratives regarding the purpose and instruments by which migration occurs, with US value claims narrowing over time emphasizing border security. This narrative trajectory within US media ignores migrants' determination and underlining rationales for migration, pushing them to take increasingly dangerous means to migrate to the USA and exacerbating the situation for all parties. © 2022 International Organization for Migration.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Teachers and students faced the challenge of communicating virtually and applying different teaching methods to put them beyond their comfort limits. The learning process is conducted in a fully electronic environment, which must be organized so that the materials provided are accessible to all learners. The aim of our paper is to propose a multi-layered e-learning framework that integrates methods and tools for managing the learning process in higher education. We based the current study on the experience gained during the pandemic in the training of Latvian and Bulgarian students. As part of our study, we conducted a survey among computer science students to examine the challenges they faced during the lockdown. To process the results, we applied the methods of statistical analysis and machine learning, particularly text mining. The total number of participants is 93, of which 48% are Latvians and the rest - Bulgarians. During the pandemic, the two groups of students used different types of conferencing software - Google Meat and MS Teams, and the same e-learning platform - Moodle. Students describe learning during lockdown as successful - with the most common grades 4 and 5. Universities have generally met their expectations. Based on our research, we offer the multi-layered higher education e-learning framework, which consists of 3 layers - human resource management, technological and policy layers. © 2021 University of Latvia.

China's governments have made relevant policies for this promising industry. This paper constructed a two-dimensional research framework of policy tools and policy objectives for quantitative study of policy texts. We analyzed 39 Chinese national policy texts from 2015 to 2019 in which the AI industry is mentioned. We found that for China's AI industry policy-making, supply-side policy tools are most widely used, whereas the application of environmental-side and demand-side policy tools are relatively limited. The policy objectives mainly focused on industrial upgrading. Due to the uneven distribution of policy tools applications, we put forward some suggestions for better AI industrial policy-making. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

There is growing evidence that social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) play a substantial effect in a wide range of health outcomes. Electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely employed to conduct observational studies in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). However, there has been limited review into how to make the most of SBDH information from EHRs using AI approaches. Methods. A systematic search was conducted in six databases to find relevant peer-reviewed publications that had recently been published. Relevance was determined by screening and evaluating the articles. Based on selected relevant studies, a methodological analysis of AI algorithms leveraging SBDH information in EHR data was provided. Results. Our synthesis was driven by an analysis of SBDH categories, the relationship between SBDH and healthcare-related statuses, natural language processing (NLP) approaches for extracting SBDH from clinical notes, and predictive models using SBDH for health outcomes. Discussion. The associations between SBDH and health outcomes are complicated and diverse; several pathways may be involved. Using NLP technology to support the extraction of SBDH and other clinical ideas simplifies the identification and extraction of essential concepts from clinical data, efficiently unlocks unstructured data, and aids in the resolution of unstructured data-related issues. Conclusion. Despite known associations between SBDH and diseases, SBDH factors are rarely investigated as interventions to improve patient outcomes. Gaining knowledge about SBDH and how SBDH data can be collected from EHRs using NLP approaches and predictive models improves the chances of influencing health policy change for patient wellness, ultimately promoting health and health equity.

The acuteness, global scale and intense dynamism of the situation make online news and information even more important for making informed management and policy decisions. This paper focuses on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to examine the news media as the main source of information and agenda-setters of public discourse over an eight-month period. The aim of this study is to understand which economic topics news media focused on alongside the dominant health coverage, which topics did not surface, and how these topics influenced each other and evolved over time and space. To this end, we used an extensive open-source dataset of over 350,000 media articles on non-medical aspects of COVID-19 retrieved from over 60 top-tier business blogs and news sites. We referred to the World Economic Forum’s Strategic Intelligence taxonomy to categorize the articles into a variety of topics. In doing so, we found that in the early days of COVID-19, the news media focused predominantly on reporting new cases, which tended to overshadow other topics, such as the economic impact of the virus. Different independent news sources reported on the same topics, showing a herd behavior of the news media during this global health crisis. However, a temporal analysis of news distribution in relation to its geographic focus showed that the rise in COVID-19 cases was associated with an increase in media coverage of relevant socio-economic topics. This research helps prepare for the prevention of social and economic crises when decision-makers closely monitor news coverage of viruses and related topics in other parts of the world. Thus, monitoring the news landscape on a global scale can support decision-making in social and economic crises. Our analyses point to ways in which this monitoring and issues management can be improved to remain alert to social dynamics and market changes. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We employed natural language processing (NLP) on Weibo text data to uncover how people’s emotions towards these containment measures changed over time and space. Our analysis reveals a critical evolution in public sentiment, transitioning from initial support to growing dissatisfaction, highlighting the impact of ‘pandemic fatigue’ and the socio-economic factors influencing these shifts. This study contributes to understanding the complex interplay between public health strategies and societal reactions, providing practical insights into the spatial variations of sentiment across different demographic and socio-economic groups. By elucidating the causal effects of containment policies on public sentiment and the subsequent rise in public skepticism, our research offers valuable lessons for policymakers in tailoring communication and interventions to mitigate negative public perceptions and foster compliance during health crises. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recently, the field met new challenges where new algorithms must contend with highly unstructured sources for sentiment expressions emanating from online social media fora. This study proposes a lexicon-based procedure to implement tweets sentiment analysis with improved algorithms. To deal with sources devoid of syntactic and grammatical structure, the approach incorporates lexicon-based text pre-processing using lexicon features such as tokenisation, parts-of-speech (POS), stop word removal, stemming, normalisation, word frequency and count for context analysis. However, since data in social network sites that primarily express sentiments are in multimodal forms, an analysis of multimedia content is required (i.e. retrieving text from audio, image and video). Hence a novel lexicon-based methodology and framework for multimodal sentiment analysis of text congregated from audio, images, and videos have been proposed. The lexicon-based approach classified the contents as positive, negative or neutral. The experiment results from STS-Gold datasets (recall = 93.2%, precision = 81.9%, F1-score = 87.2%, Accuracy = 92.29%) show the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared with those of other state-of-the-art research studies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since then, the law has been revised twice, and many improvements have been made, including the establishment of the Korea Consumer Protection Agency. Therefore, this study focuses on an empirical investigation of how media reports are conveying ‘consumer policy’ through a chronicle of the presidents. In this research, text mining and semantic network analysis were used on 2216 articles related to ‘consumer policy’ reported by governments from the Kim Yong-Sam government to the Park Geun-Hye government to 12 media.

Methods: A total of 339 nurse-related articles published in Korean online newspapers from January 1 to December 31, 2020, were extracted by entering various combinations of OR and AND with the four words “Corona,” “COVID,” “Nursing,” and “Nurse” as search keywords using BIGKinds, a news database provided by the Korea Press Foundation. The collected data were analyzed with a keyword network analysis and topic modeling using NetMiner 4. Results: The top keywords extracted from the nurse-related news articles were, in the following order, “metropolitan area,” “protective clothing,” “government,” “task,” and “admission.” Four topics representing keywords were identified: “encouragement for dedicated nurses,” “poor work environment,” “front-line nurses working with obligation during the COVID-19 pandemic,” and “nurses' efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” Conclusion: The media’s attention to the dedication of nurses, the shortage of nursing resources, and the need for government support is encouraging in that it forms the public opinion necessary to lead to substantial improvements in treating nurses. The nursing community should actively promote policy proposals to improve treatment toward nurses by utilizing the net function of the media and proactively seek and apply strategies to improve the image of nurses working in various fields.

The study of impact, to date, has focused on direct and short-term mechanisms, such as alumni's entrepreneurial activities, faculty spin-outs, and active public engagement with policy agendas. Our point of departure is in conceptualizing and empirically testing a longer-term and more systemic mechanism. We theorize and empirically test how the entrepreneurial university imprints on its graduates, some of whom take on leadership positions in innovation policymaking years later. We test this relationship by employing a text-as-data approach to examine the extent to which innovation policy leaders speak about startup-centric innovation, comparing the media coverage of entrepreneurial university alumni relative to their peers. Our original dataset comprises the 485 individuals who held senior innovation policy positions in East Asia's eleven largest economies from 1998 to 2019, detailing their educational background and media coverage (10,816 documents). We conceptualize the alumni policymaker mechanism, which constitutes entrepreneurial university alumni shaping the future of national innovation policy by referring to startup-centric innovation three times more than their peers. Those who completed MBAs at entrepreneurial universities express an even greater preference for startup-centric innovation policy.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Definition, Factors for Enhancing Students Comprehension, and Computational Bibliometric Review Analysis\n                    ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to explain language education development research for improving student comprehension in learning science. This study also reviews the definition of these strategies, identifies factors that contribute to improving students' comprehension, and conducts a computational bibliometric review analysis to determine the efficacy of these approaches using Google Scholar with keywords Language and Learning Science from 2019 to 2023. There are also explanations for formal and informal learning, as well as educational levels for researching techniques and developing curriculum. The use of technology in media and laboratories is also a significant factor in increasing students' literacy and language impact. Language and student characteristics, motivation, teacher-student relationships, therapy, and psychological conditions are all inextricably linked. We also included information about language barriers for students with special needs, as well as new technologies that improve language learning, in which these can be factors in increasing student’s understanding of learning science. The bibliometric analysis results show that the trend of language research in learning science is decreasing year after year. This is due to the possibility that the focus of educational research has shifted to other areas, such as educational technology, science learning, or educational policy. The co-occurrence analysis results show several keywords that are frequently researched and should be paid attention to, including language model, natural language processing, deep learning, student, and language learning. These keywords denote important parameters that can improve the learning experience because they enable personalized, interactive, adaptive educational interventions, particularly in language learning contexts, by adapting content and feedback to each student's needs and preferences. This paper will be useful to educators in better understanding the current state of affairs concerning the importance of language in engineering teaching and learning. © 2023, Universitas Negeri Makassar- Faculty of Languages and Literature.

We define deception as the systematic inducement of false beliefs in the pursuit of some outcome other than the truth. We first survey empirical examples of AI deception, discussing both special-use AI systems (including Meta's CICERO) and general-purpose AI systems (including large language models). Next, we detail several risks from AI deception, such as fraud, election tampering, and losing control of AI. Finally, we outline several potential solutions: first, regulatory frameworks should subject AI systems that are capable of deception to robust risk-assessment requirements; second, policymakers should implement bot-or-not laws; and finally, policymakers should prioritize the funding of relevant research, including tools to detect AI deception and to make AI systems less deceptive. Policymakers, researchers, and the broader public should work proactively to prevent AI deception from destabilizing the shared foundations of our society. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, studies on the implementation of this policy proposition are limited. To address this gap in the literature, this study employs machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing (NLP), to examine 77 climate bond (CB) policies from 32 countries within the context of climate financing. The findings indicate that “sustainability” and “carbon emissions control” are the most outlined policy objectives in these CB policies. Additionally, the study highlights that most CB funds are invested toward energy projects (i.e., renewable, clean, and efficient initiatives). However, there has been a notable shift in the allocation of CB funds from climate-friendly energy projects to the construction sector between 2015 and 2019. This shift raises concerns about the potential redirection of funds from climate-focused investments to the real estate industry, potentially leading to the greenwashing of climate funds. Furthermore, policy sentiment analysis revealed that a minority of policies hold skeptical views on climate change, which may negatively influence climate actions. Thus, the findings highlight that the effective implementation of CB policies depends on policy goals, objectives, and sentiments. Finally, this study contributes to the literature by employing NLP techniques to understand policy sentiments in climate financing. © 2023 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Efects of LLM-Powered Search Systems on Diverse Information Seeking\n                    ABSTRACT: Large language models (LLMs) powered conversational search systems have already been used by hundreds of millions of people, and are believed to bring many benefits over conventional search. However, while decades of research and public discourse interrogated the risk of search systems in increasing selective exposure and creating echo chambers-limiting exposure to diverse opinions and leading to opinion polarization, little is known about such a risk of LLM-powered conversational search. We conduct two experiments to investigate: 1) whether and how LLM-powered conversational search increases selective exposure compared to conventional search; 2) whether and how LLMs with opinion biases that either reinforce or challenge the user's view change the effect. Overall, we found that participants engaged in more biased information querying with LLM-powered conversational search, and an opinionated LLM reinforcing their views exacerbated this bias.

In Taiwan, the fertility rate is experiencing long-Term downtrends, and consequently, ageing of their populations. In view of this, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the yearly trend for population ageing and declining fertility. We proposed the yearly trend analysis based on contextual text mining methods from government science and technology projects to extract the Chinese pattern and word about the population ageing and declining fertility. The government science and technology projects, which archives research projects sponsored by government, are retrieved from Government Research Bulletin (GRB) from 1981 to April 2021. Then, the two issue of policy Major trends and the importance of issues and Policies and action plans combine the population ageing and declining fertility with yearly trend are explored and discussed. The obtained results can be analyzed the yearly trend about fertility rate, elderly population, and youth workforce with population ageing and declining fertility on the first policy issue Major trends and the importance of issues. And it can also be analyzed the yearly trend about formulates the policies and action plan on the second policy issue Policies and action plans in Taiwan. According to the results of the analysis, we observe that the fertility rate and youth workforce have been a progressive decrease every year. Within 10 years, it will be expected to transition into a super-Aged society about the elderly population. In the future, the specify topic of population ageing and declining fertility with yearly trend will be analyzed on other policy issues by government. The analysis with yearly trend is used by the government to evaluate how to allocate research funding to the specify topic and it can be as the reference for decision of government in Taiwan. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

In ERBAC, the abstract concept of “permission” in RBAC96 is substituted by a set of “tasks”, mutual exclusion of basic business actions and mutual exclusion of roles are presented, and separation of duty (SoD) policy is defined formally. Furthermore, a method of identifying mutual exclusion of roles is described, and static SoD and dynamic SoD algorithms are discussed. This paper is significant for modeling and implementing business-oriented SoD policy for information systems. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Within a life-long interactive learning period, the agent, trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), must be able to handle natural conversations with human users, and achieve good learning performance (i.e. accuracy) while minimising human effort in the learning process. We train and evaluate this system in interaction with a simulated human tutor, which is built on the BURCHAK corpus - a Human-Human Dialogue dataset for the visual learning task. The results show that: 1) The learned policy can coherently interact with the simulated user to achieve the goal of the task (i.e. learning visual attributes of objects, e.g. colour and shape); and 2) it finds a better trade-off between classifier accuracy and tutoring costs than hand-crafted rule-based policies, including ones with dynamic policies. © 2017 Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Language Grounding for Robotics, RoboNLP 2017 at the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017.

Supervised deep learning and natural language processing potentially enable classification of these data but require high quality labeled inputs. This study investigates whether hybridizing rigorous qualitative coding methods with machine learning approaches can classify large amounts of policy-oriented text data (public comments) while keeping manual effort tractable. Using a convolutional neural network, we evaluate spatiotemporal variation in themes and expressed public attitudes toward a specific US climate policy, the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was proposed in 2014 and repealed in 2019 without ever taking effect. Public comments were solicited for both the proposal and proposed repeal across eight cities, representing a large and highly targeted dataset on dynamic public attitudes toward the CPP. Rigorous manual coding and data augmentation techniques enabled good model performance (F1 scores of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively, for sentiment and topic classification), even with a very small training set. We find that most speakers supported the CPP despite its eventual repeal and uncover notable rhetorical trends like competing narratives of justice for those affected by climate change versus fossil fuel host communities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These concerns have piqued the interest of researchers, who have advanced new approaches and theoretical insights to enhance data gathering, treatment and models’ training. Nonetheless, few works have looked at the trade-offs between appropriateness and accuracy in indicator evaluation to comprehend how these constraints and approaches may better redound into policymaking and have a more significant impact across culture and sustainability matters for urban governance. This empirical study fulfils this void by researching indicators’ accuracy and utilizing algorithmic models to test the benefits of large text-based analysis. Here we describe applied work in which we find affinity and occurrence in indicators trade-offs that result be significant in practice to evaluate large texts. In the study, objectivity and fairness are kept substantially without sacrificing accuracy, explicitly focusing on improving the processing of indicators to be truthfully assessed. This observation is robust when cross-referring indicators and unique words. The empirical results advance a novel form of large text analysis through machine intelligence and refute a widely held belief that artificial intelligence text processing necessitates either accepting a significant reduction in accuracy or fairness. © 2023, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

By simulating public opinion, ChatGPT shows promise in facilitating public policy development. However, challenges persist regarding its worldwide applicability and bias across demographics and themes. Our research employs socio-demographic data from the World Values Survey to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance in diverse contexts. Findings indicate significant performance disparities, especially when comparing countries. Models perform better in Western, English-speaking, and developed nations, notably the United States, in comparison to others. Disparities also manifest across demographic groups, showing biases related to gender, ethnicity, age, education, and social class. The study further uncovers thematic biases in political and environmental simulations. These results highlight the need to enhance LLMs’ representativeness and address biases, ensuring their equitable and effective integration into public opinion research alongside conventional methodologies. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research paper aims to explore the factors contributing to Ph.D. students' decision to dropout and their interrelationships. For this purpose, we employed the hybrid topic modeling Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers – Latent Dirichlet Allocation (BERT-LDA) algorithm and Numerical Association Rule Mining (NARM) using a genetic algorithm in QuantMiner. We identified and analyzed individual, institutional, and social factors that affect Ph.D. students in leaving their current degrees. The results suggest that financial constraints, inadequate academic preparation, poor mentoring, social isolation, lack of social support, family responsibilities, and work-life balance are significant elements responsible for dropout. These findings also reveal that these factors are interrelated, and their effects can be mitigated by the academic institution's policies and culture. The outcomes of the study have implications for academic institutions, policymakers, and researchers, who can use them to develop evidence-based strategies and interventions that enhance Ph.D. students' retention and success. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The following results were obtained. (1) A thematic cross-sectional analysis identified six core policy themes, namely, coordinated promotion of technology and finance, industry development and safety standardisation, market service and technical support systems, promotion strategy and urban cluster development, industrial capital and safety supervision mechanisms, and policy support and market expansion. The analysis also mapped the distribution of hot spots within these themes. (2) The keyword co-occurrence network of the NEV policy indicated that the network structure evolved from an initial ‘overall dispersion–theme concentration’, comprising 16 policy themes, to an ‘overall stability–theme coordination’, consisting of 14 policy themes. (3) The coordination degrees across the three types of policies exhibited a consistent upward spiral, with the comprehensive coordination index surging from 30 in 2007 to 951 in 2023, underscoring the complementary effects among policy instruments. These conclusions offer valuable insights for government departments to understand NEV development trends and dynamically adjust policy themes accordingly. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Tracking the development trajectory of offshore wind technology (OWT) becomes essential for maintaining competitiveness in the global market. While existing studies have explored OWT development through expert knowledge and qualitative methods, few have quantitatively examined its detailed evolution paths. This study proposes a novel macro-micro analysis framework leveraging patent text mining methods. The framework aims to uncover both the overall development patterns and detailed technical evolution paths of OWT, informing decisions across academia, policy, and industry. At the macro level, the analysis depicts global innovation trends, major patent applicants, and the distribution of technology categories. The tracking results reveal distinct regional innovation patterns and highlight the leading role of government in offshore wind development. At the micro level, the framework identifies the technical evolution paths across three major fields, revealing key R&D hotspots and lifecycle stages of sub-technical categories. Through systematic patent text mining and multi-level analysis, this study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of OWT development trajectory and provides evidence-based support for future technology planning and innovation strategies. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We employ an incentivized online experiment (N = 532) where participants are randomly assigned to recall one of three situations in their past: a time they behaved immorally in the interpersonal domain, a time they behaved immorally in the environmental domain, or a neutral event. Participants can then engage in an act of moral cleansing that is either costly (donating part of the participation bonus) or costless (expressing an intention to sign a petition), and choose the beneficiary of the prosocial behavior. Sentiment analysis of the content of the recalls confirms that recalling an immoral behavior, independently of the domain, leads to more negative sentiment than recalling a neutral event. This effect is particularly strong when recalling an immoral behavior in the interpersonal domain. Recalling immoral behaviors in the interpersonal domain influenced the relative composition of donation versus petition behavior, but not the overall amount of prosocial behavior. In particular, it increases the probability of engaging in costly moral cleansing and reduces engagement in costless moral cleansing. However, when the immoral behavior is in the environmental domain, participants do not display even costless moral cleansing. Finally, we observe a preference for compensating in the same broad domain as the immoral behavior. Our results extend the understanding of moral cleansing and suggest some policy implications, especially advising against counting on the ability of pro-environmental morality to guide behavior. © 2022 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In order to fully explore the relationship between policy factors and load, and improve the accuracy of load forecasting, a quantitative method of power policy based on policy modeling consistency (PMC) index was proposed and it was applied to load forecasting. Firstly, the PMC evaluation system of electric power field was established, and then the PMC index of power policy text was obtained by text mining technology. Finally, the load forecasting model based on long shrot term memory was constructed. The quantitative index of power policy, weather, date and other influencing factors were input into the model, and compared with the model without considering policy factors. The experiment shows that the load forecasting model with policy factors achieves good results. After adding policy quantitative data, the error mean absolute percentage error of load forecasting model is reduced from 1.67 to 0.98, and mean absolute error is reduced from 28.97 to 19.68, which indicates that PMC model has a certain ability of policy quantification. © 2022 Chinese Journal of Intelligent Science and Technology.

Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, this article presents a case study employing sentiment analysis on unstructured social media data from Twitter (now X) to gauge public sentiment regarding pandemic-related restrictions. Our study aims to uncover and analyze Jamaican citizens’ emotions and opinions surrounding COVID-19 restrictions following an outbreak at a call center in April 2020. Machine learning sentiment analysis was used to analyze tweets from Twitter related to the lockdown. A total of 1 609 tweets were retrieved and analyzed, 76% of which expressed negative sentiments, suggesting that the majority of citizens were not in favor of the restrictions. The low compliance with the government-mandated policy may be related to the high percentage of negative sentiments expressed. Insights from citizens’ sentiments derived from open data sources such as Twitter can serve as valuable indicators for public health policymakers, providing critical input that will aid in tailoring interventions that align with public sentiments, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of and compliance with public health policies. This type of analysis can be useful to the health community and more generally to governments, as it allows for a more scientific assessment of public response to public health intervention techniques in real time. This study contributes to the emerging discourse on the integration of nontraditional data into public health policy-making, highlighting the growing potential for the use of these novel analytic techniques in addressing complex public health challenges. © 2024 Pan American Health Organization.

However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive application of this factor in oil price forecasting, primarily due to the complexity of measuring such policy evolutions. To address this research gap, this study develops a news-based OPEC+ policy index based on text mining methods for comprehensive analysis and forecasting of the oil price. First, by crawling and mining news headlines related to OPEC+ production decisions, a dynamic and high-frequency (weekly) OPEC+ policy index is established. Second, the linear and nonlinear relationship between the proposed OPEC+ policy index and the WTI crude oil futures price is thoroughly examined, assessing the potential predictive power of the index in explaining the movements of the crude oil price. Third, the forecasting efficacy of the constructed index on the oil price is rigorously evaluated across eight econometric and machine learning models. Key findings include: (1) The proposed weekly OPEC+ policy index demonstrates strong concordance with OPEC+ production change decisions, exhibiting notable peaks and troughs corresponding to OPEC+ Ministerial Meetings. (2) The relationship analysis demonstrates a strong linear and nonlinear association between the proposed OPEC+ policy index and the crude oil price. (3) For oil price prediction, models incorporating our proposed OPEC+ policy index demonstrate superior performance compared to models without this index. In particular, the index exhibits a more significant predictive effect within three-week forecasting horizons and performs exceptionally well during periods of pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In addition, the OPEC+ policy index also exhibits a significant predictive effect on the daily crude oil price and natural gas price, further confirming the robust and powerful forecasting capability of this index within the energy system. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Although researchers have designed methods to identify the conflict between app behavior and privacy policies, little is known about the privacy compliance issues relevant to third-party libraries (TPLs). The regulators enacted articles to regulate the usage of personal information for TPLs (e.g., the CCPA requires businesses clearly notify consumers if they share consumers' data with third parties or not). However, it remains challenging to investigate the privacy compliance issues of TPLs due to three reasons: 1) Difficulties in collecting TPLs' privacy policies. In contrast to Android apps, which are distributed through markets like Google Play and must provide privacy policies, there is no unique platform for collecting privacy policies of TPLs. 2) Difficulties in analyzing TPL's user privacy access behaviors. TPLs are mainly provided in binary files, such as jar or aar, and their whole functionalities usually cannot be executed independently without host apps. 3) Difficulties in identifying consistency between TPL's functionalities and privacy policies, and host app's privacy policy and data sharing with TPLs. This requires analyzing not only the privacy policies of TPLs and host apps but also their functionalities. In this paper, we propose an automated system named ATPChecker to analyze whether Android TPLs comply with the privacy-related regulations. We construct a data set that contains a list of 458 TPLs, 247 TPL's privacy policies, 187 TPL's binary files and 641 host apps and their privacy policies. Then, we analyze the bytecode of TPLs and host apps, design natural language processing systems to analyze privacy policies, and implement an expert system to identify TPL usage-related regulation compliance. The experimental results show that 23% TPLs violate regulation requirements for providing privacy policies. Over 47% TPLs miss disclosing data usage in their privacy policies. Over 65% host apps share user data with TPLs while 65% of them miss disclosing interactions with TPLs.

The research addresses two primary questions: What are the prevailing sentiments toward remote work in the post-pandemic period, and how do these sentiments compare to initial reactions at the pandemic's onset? Using sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, the study analyzes tweets containing the keyword Remote Work.The findings reveal a strong positive sentiment towards remote work, with 63% of tweets classified as positive, reflecting the perceived benefits of flexibility, improved work-life balance, and broader job opportunities, especially in technology, management, and engineering roles. The LDA analysis identifies ten distinct themes, including the impact of remote work on education, health, public policy, and the job market. These insights underscore the importance of collaboration and team culture in sustaining effective remote and hybrid work environments. The study's findings are significant in highlighting the ongoing acceptance and adaptation to remote work, which is likely to shape the future of work in profound ways. However, the research also acknowledges its limitations, such as the reliance on a single social media platform and the potential biases in sentiment analysis. Future research should consider integrating data from multiple sources to provide a more comprehensive understanding of remote work dynamics.  © 2013 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Methods: By means of the text mining and literature research method, the Policy Modeling Consistency Index (PMC-index) model of CHI policies was constructed. The model was used to analyze the 22 policies individually and as a whole to describe the current situation of CHI policies in China. Results: The PMC-index model consisted of 10 primary variables and 41 secondary variables. This study found that the average PMC index of the 22 policies included is 7.48, suggesting that existing policies are generally of high quality. Among them, good policies accounted for 18.18%, and excellent policies accounted for 81.82%. Among the primary variables, X10 (policy disclosure) had the highest score, and the scores of other primary variables were ranked as X3 (policy recipients) > X5 (policy content) > X6 (policy tools) > X8 (cooperation and connection) > X7 (content evaluation) > X1 (policy nature) > X9 (policy goals) > X4 (policy incentives) > X2 (policy timeliness). Conclusions: At present, China’s CHI policies are generally at an excellent level. However, there is still room for improvement with regard to “policy incentives, policy goals, content evaluation, policy tools and policy content”. We recommend that policymakers optimize China’s CHI policies by improving the policy incentive mechanism; balancing policy goals; clarifying task distribution; optimizing policy tool structure; and developing inclusive health insurance. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The speed in disseminating reliable information and the subsequent guidelines and policy implementation are also essential to save as many lives as possible. Trustworthy guidelines should be based on a systematic evidence review which uses reproducible analytical methods to collect secondary data and analyse them. However, the guidelines’ drafting process is time consuming and requires a great deal of resources. This paper aims to highlight the importance of accelerating and streamlining the extraction and synthesis of scientific evidence, specifically within the systematic review process. To do so, this paper describes the COKE (COVID-19 Knowledge Extraction framework for next generation discovery science) Project, which involves the use of machine reading and deep learning to design and implement a semi-automated system that supports and enhances the systematic literature review and guideline drafting processes. Specifically, we propose a framework for aiding in the literature selection and navigation process that employs natural language processing and clustering techniques for selecting and organizing the literature for human consultation, according to PICO (Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) elements. We show some preliminary results of the automatic classification of sentences on a dataset of abstracts related to COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.

The mental health of readers and viewers can also be affected by the media after tragic events. Potentially, the media have a proactive role in shaping the actions of the mass population and thereby influencing policy actions. The print media especially are considered a key avenue for taking information to the masses. However, in this information and communications technology (ICT) era, people are increasingly reluctant to carry hard-copy newspapers, instead preferring e-newspapers. At the present time, entire newspapers, and especially their opinion sections, are deluged by concerns about the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. After China and Japan first encountered COVID-19, other Asian countries began their COVID-19 fight at different times between January and March 2020. All affected countries sought to manage the pandemic in their own way, following lessons learned from China and Japan. Every form of media in affected countries highlighted concerns by presenting news, perceptions, and opinions related to the pandemic. With opinion sections and editorials, the key sections of e-newspapers to reflect experts' perceptions and thoughts, this study aims to examine experts' views in the e-newspapers of five different countries in Asia, in relation to China and Japan. Considering the diversity of socioeconomic and geopolitical settings, five countries - South Korea, Singapore, Iran, India, and Bangladesh - are selected, each represented by one leading English-language e-newspaper. This study explores how experts' perceptions in the studied countries present different aspects of life. It also examines which e-newspaper emphasized which aspect of life and in which period of the outbreak. By intensive text mining in each selected e-newspaper, the study found that experts' opinions addressed diverse issues with regard to COVID-19. These issues are grouped under the following eight categories: health and drugs, preparedness and awareness, social welfare and humanity, the economy, governance and institutions, politics, the environment and wildlife, and innovation and technology. This pioneering study of five different e-newspapers in Asian countries from January to March 2020 presents a similar picture of experts' concerns and their roles in shaping responses to health crises; thus, it plays a role in contributing to policy actions.  © 2020 Parvin, Ahsan, Rahman and Abedin.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Future lifestyle changes in developed countries are expected to result in significant energy use reductions of up to 50% by 2050, with a correspondingly large impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, neither clear categorizations of behavioral or nontechnological (NT) climate mitigation solutions (CMS), nor corresponding estimates of global potentials for energy savings and GHG mitigation are available. Using a systematic map methodology, review of frameworks, and topic modeling, Results indicate a literature bias toward developed countries, we propose a taxonomy that conceptually covers various demands (maintained/reduced), perspectives (individual/collective), and direct energy use (yes/no), resulting in five types of NT solutions: active and passive management and operation (MO), demand flexibility, sufficient comfort levels, circular and sharing economy, and organizational and social innovations. A knowledge glut for active and passive MO has been identified, with clusters in Europe and North America. Furthermore, evidence gaps were discovered in terms of geographical scope (with very little literature available about Africa and the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia), stakeholder perspectives, and some measures (circular and sharing economy, flexibility of demand over time, social and organizational innovations). There was insufficient evidence on current NT CMS adoption and implementation costs. Quantified potentials were mostly found for developed countries and residential buildings, with more energy savings than GHG mitigation studies. Whereas these potentials are substantial, they vary largely among regions and solutions. The potential energy-saving ranges between 5% and 40% for most regions and CMS. The greatest potential GHG emissions reductions are seen in the circular and sharing category (25% to 70%). For other actions, most potentials range from 5% to 30%. More research is needed to provide evidence on rebound effects that can offset the climate benefits of NT solutions, business models that demonstrate their financial viability, and policy actions that trigger the already identified climate mitigation potentials of NT solutions. © 2021\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Forcing social animals to maintain physical distance has presented significant challenges for health authorities and law enforcement. Anecdotal media reports suggest widespread dissatisfaction with social distancing as a policy, yet there is little prior work aimed at measuring community acceptance of social distancing. In this paper, we propose a new approach to measuring attitudes towards social distancing by using social media and sentiment analysis. Over a four-month period, we found that 82.5 percent of tweets were in favour of social distancing. The results indicate a widespread acceptance of social distancing in a selected community. We examine options for estimating the optimal (minimal) social distance required at scale, and the implications for securing widespread community support and for appropriate crisis management during emergency health events. © 2020, A.S.M.

Ethical complexities surround AI, including privacy concerns, social deployment, and nonhuman decision-making. This project included English-language, peer-reviewed surveys and reviews published within the past five years. It also conducts topic modeling of one year's worth of social media data. Data were gathered from various academic databases and social media platforms and analyzed with topic modeling and sentiment analysis to provide external validation of insights into public sentiment and attitudes towards AI. Surveys and reviews worldwide revealed an understanding of AI concepts and positive sentiment toward AI integration in healthcare. Concerns persisted regarding data privacy, safety, and AI's impact on employment. Individual factors like age and education influence attitudes. Reviews mirrored survey findings with safety concerns about autonomous vehicles and calls for collaboration and regulation in clinical AI implementation. Social media discussions delved into AI's ethical, market, and policy implications, but Quora leaned more positively and Reddit more speculatively. Reviews, surveys, and social media provide insights into global attitudes toward AI, highlighting widespread understanding but persistent concerns. Collaboration, regulation, and ongoing education are essential for responsible AI integration across domains and regions to address privacy, security, and ethical concerns. Designers must prioritize transparency, accountability, and human-centered design to build trust and address public apprehensions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Traditional methods for gauging this sentiment, however, are limited in scalability and reproducibility over time. This paper reviews the application of sentiment analysis in energy research, highlighting its potential to overcome these limitations by providing large-scale, quantifiable data across diverse energy technologies and geographies. By showcasing integrations of sentiment analysis with topic modeling, this review showcases approaches that enhance the understanding of public opinions and support more informed policy-making. This paper finds that researchers have leveraged a wide range of data sources, including social media, news reports, research papers, and transcripts of interviews and speeches, but have often relied on suboptimal models to perform the sentiment classification. In line with existing literature, our quantitative model comparison indicates that transformer-based and large language model approaches can improve classification accuracy by up to 20% compared to traditional lexicon-based methods. In particular, this study is the first to compare GPT model performance in an energy context. To support future research, this review provides practical guidance on model selection in sentiment analysis, lowering the technical barrier to adoption. By encouraging broader use of sentiment analysis, this work aims to improve public response forecasting, facilitating the development of more effective energy policies and advancing energy technologies. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In response to this problem, this paper integrates the internet, public information, market credit information, and other data, uses hidden Markov models and natural language processing technology, and establishes a modern government public policy and public opinion monitoring and early warning model to evaluate government credit in real time; the government can formulate relevant policies based on the evaluation results to improve the government's governance capabilities. Empirical analysis shows that, based on the dynamic scoring framework and Markov model, the government credit monitoring and early warning models established, respectively, have 90% of the reference value, and the analysis results have the same reference. This method can effectively predict the trend of hot online public opinion. The subsequent establishment of an online public opinion early warning system and an online public opinion guidance mechanism provided theoretical support. © 2021 Zi Li.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, we examine a new avenue of bureaucratic response to politics—tone shifts in annual reporting. Specifically, we use sentiment analysis to gauge shifts in bureaucratic language after a change in party control of government in U.S. states. Our sample includes the text of reports from higher education agencies in five states over an extended period. We argue bureaucrats modify the framing of policy issues to appeal to the perspective of the party in power. The results further the notion that bureaucratic actors are acutely aware of and reactive to their political surroundings in a variety of ways, adding to the literature about bureaucrats as strategic actors. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Public opinion regarding COVID-19 can be processed to get a sentiment so that it is useful in making a decision or policy. In this study, sentiment analysis was done using a stacking method on Indonesian-language tweet data related to COVID-19. Sentistrength_id is used for sentiment labeling on tweet data that has been collected so that sentiment labels can be obtained in the form of positive and negative class. The sentiment analysis carried out on the tweet data resulted in a positive opinion class of 1879 and negative opinion of 1706. From these data the classification was done using stacking of naïve bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Regression as base learner and Support Vector Machine as meta learner. The classification result produce a value in accuracy, precision and recall of 85.6%, 86% and 86%, respectively.. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research aims to identify core topics in TIM studies and explore their dynamic changes. The conventional approach, based on discrete assignments by subjective judgment with predetermined categories, cannot effectively capture latent topics from large volumes of scholarly data. Hence, this study adopts the topic model approach, which automatically discovers topics that pervade a large and unstructured collection of documents, to uncover research topics in TIM research. The 50 topics of TIM research are identified through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model from 11,693 articles published from 1997 to 2016 in 11 TIM journals, and top 10 most popular topics in TIM research are briefly reviewed. We then explore topic trends by examining the changes in topics rankings over different time periods and identifying hot and cold topics of TIM research over the last two decades. For each of the 11 TIM journals, the areas of subspecialty and the effects of editor changes on topic portfolios are also investigated. The findings of this study are expected to provide implications for researchers, journal editors, and policy makers in the field of TIM. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the critical discourse on bridging the vast knowledge gap between experts who shape and implement standards for LLMs and users whose values are at stake remains largely unaddressed. Taking a “bottom-up” perspective and using a mixed-method approach, we first conducted interviews (N = 12) to engage with users’ perceptions of normative standards in the context of LLMs. We thereby identified 68 specific criteria that users’ consider when evaluating whether their values are fulfilled. Second, we conducted an online survey (N = 379) to further investigate how users prioritize these standards and the identified criteria in conversational LLM-based applications. Our findings reveal opportunities for strategic communication measures, the importance of transparent governance mechanisms and the necessity of non-technical complements to technical solutions for bridging the knowledge gap. We discuss actionable steps to effectively communicate trustworthy AI standards. Copyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In this paper, we retrieved all accessible texts related to K-12 CT education on the Quora platform. The textual data obtained ranged from June 2010 to September 2022. We then performed topic modeling analysis to identify major topics and uncover meaningful themes of the public responses to CT education initiatives. In general, people expressed positive comments about CT education. However, they were still concerned about the difficulties in learning and education equality for disadvantaged groups. In addition, since CT practices develop students' essential skills in the job market, people may overestimate the outcomes of CT education. Our findings provide insights into public perceptions of children’s CT education. The results of this study can facilitate education policymaking, curriculum design, and further research directions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper presents a classroom study to investigate this comparison in a college level Computer Science (CS) course where groups of students worked collaboratively to design database access strategies. Forty-four teams were randomly assigned to three reflection conditions ([GEN] directive to generate a contrasting case to the student solution and evaluate their trade-offs in light of the principle, [CONT] directive to compare the student solution with a provided contrasting case and evaluate their trade-offs in light of a principle, and [NSI] a control condition with a non-specific directive for reflection evaluating the student solution in light of a principle). In the CONT condition, as an illustration of the use of LLMs to exemplify knowledge transformation beyond knowledge construction in the generation of an automated contribution to a collaborative learning discussion, an LLM generated a contrasting case to a group's solution to exemplify application of an alternative problem solving strategy in a way that highlighted the contrast by keeping many concrete details the same as those the group had most recently collaboratively constructed. While there was no main effect of condition on learning based on a content test, low-pretest student learned more from CONT than GEN, with NSI not distinguishable from the other two, while high-pretest students learned marginally more from the GEN condition than the CONT condition, with NSI not distinguishable from the other two. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Reflection during or even in place of computer programming is beneficial for learning of principles for advanced computer science when the principles are new to students. Generation of contrasting cases and comparing contrasting cases have both been demonstrated to be effective as opportunities to learn from reflection in some contexts, though questions remain about ideal applicability conditions for adult learners. Intelligent conversational agents can be used effectively to deliver stimuli for reflection during collaborative learning, though room for improvement remains, which provides an opportunity to demonstrate the potential positive contribution of large language models (LLMs). What this paper adds The study contributes new knowledge related to the differences in applicability conditions between generation of contrasting cases and comparison across provided contrasting cases for adult learning. The paper presents an application of LLMs as a tool to provide contrasting cases tailored to the details of actual student solutions. The study provides evidence from a classroom intervention study for positive impact on student learning of an LLM-enabled intervention. Implications for practice and/or policy Advanced computer science curricula should make substantial room for reflection alongside problem solving. Instructors should provide reflection opportunities for students tailored to their level of prior knowledge. Instructors would benefit from training to use LLMs as tools for providing effective contrasting cases, especially for low-prior-knowledge students. © 2024 The Author(s).

Currently, consulting firms strive to use data to support client's business decisions with evidence. To be effective at this, consultants must consider the applicability of both internal and external data libraries to their clients' requirements. Frequently, evaluating the applicability of data sets is a manual process, which can be costly to the firm and the client. This paper describes a technical approach to automate this process. Specifically, it details the structure of a software application, named UVa Open Miner, capable of assessing the applicability of data sources to client projects. This UVa Open Miner aims to maximize the scale and diversity of candidate data sets, increase the relevance of data found, and maintain manageable computational complexity. UVa Open Miner consists of two segments: mapping and matching. The mapping component text mines web pages to identify an ontology of keywords describing the business requirement. This enables users to handle diverse business requirements from various industry verticals. The matching component scores data sets based on a relevance factor obtained from the ontology map. To validate the application, subject matter experts provided business requirements for a problem in their domain, and validated the application's results. Professionals in environment science, political science and policy-making fields found the application to be useful. Therefore, the application, along with the framework used, can be refactored into a reusable solution for consulting firms to use for their clients. © 2016 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Based on machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, personal data access and collection practices mentioned in app privacy policy text are analyzed to predict the required permission requests. Further, the predicted list of permission requests is compared with the real permission requests to check whether there is any mismatch. We further propose user interface designs to map mobile app permission requests to understandable language definitions for the end user. The combination of these concepts provides users with special knowledge about data protection practice and behavior of apps based on the analysis of privacy policy text and permission declaration which are otherwise difficult to analyze. Initial results demonstrate the capability of our approach in prediction of app permission requests. Also, by exploiting our already proposed app behavior analyzer tool, we investigated the correlation between what mobile apps do in reality and what they promise in their privacy policy text resulting in a positive correlation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Accordingly, EU's 2007-2013 Rural Development policy (RDP) is one framework to incorporate aspects labelled as quality of life (QOL) alongside traditional rural tenets. With a new rendition of the RDP underway, this paper scopes the content and extent of the expired RDP regarding its incorporation of QOL, in order to better identify considerations for future policy making. Using novel methodology called topic modelling, a series of latent semantic structures within the RDP could be unravelled and re-interpreted via a dual categorization system based on RDP's own view on QOL, and on definitions provided by independent research. Corroborated by other audits, the findings indicate a thematic overemphasis on agriculture, with the focus on QOL being largely insignificant. Such results point to a rationale different than the assumed one, at the same time reinforcing an outdated view of rurality in the face of the ostensibly fundamental turn towards viewing rural areas in a wider, more humanistic, perspective. This unexpected issue of underrepresentation is next addressed through three possible drivers: conceptual(lingering productionist view of the rural), ideological (capitalist prerogative preventing non-pecuniary values from entering policy) and material (institutional lock-ins incapable ofaccommodating significant deviations from an agricultural focus). The paper ends with a critical discussion and some reflections on the broader concept of rurality. © 2014 Nicolaus Copernicus University Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recently, massive new words are created and widely spread in social media, and they pose a great influence on sentiment analysis. Facing this situation, most previous work still just add those new words into sentiment lexicon, none of the existed researches focuses on the role and influence of new words in emotional expression. In this paper, we pay more attention to the influence of new words and propose two novel new words based sentiment analysis methods, named NWLb and NWSA, the former only with the help of lexicon and the latter further incorporates machine learning, which utilize the distinctive role of new words to improve the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in social media. Experiments on real social media dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of our methods. © 2016 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We present a supervised ensemble n-gram model for ideology extraction with topic adjustments and apply it to one such domain: research papers written by academic economists. We show economists' political leanings can be correctly predicted, that our predictions generalize to new domains, and that they correlate with public policy-relevant research findings. We also present evidence that unsupervised models can under-perform in domains where ideological expression is discouraged. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper introduces an emotion-based classification model to analyze the human behavior in reaction to some event described by a tweet trend. From tweets analysis, the model extracts terms expressing emotions, and then, it builds a topological space of emotion-based concepts. These concepts enable the training of the multi-class SVM classifier to identify emotions expressed in the tweets. Classifier results are “softly” interpreted as a blending of several emotional nuances which thoroughly depicts people’s feeling. An ontology model captures the emotional concepts returned by classification, with respect to the tweet trends. The associated knowledge base provides human behavior analysis, in response to an event, by a tweet trend, by SPARQL queries. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recent work has made progress in leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to automate privacy policy analysis and extract data collection statements from different sentences, considered in isolation from each other. In this paper, we view and analyze, for the first time, the entire text of a privacy policy in an integrated way. In terms of methodology: (1) we define POLIGRAPH, a type of knowledge graph that captures statements in a privacy policy as relations between different parts of the text; and (2) we develop an NLP-based tool, POLIGRAPH-ER, to automatically extract POLIGRAPH from the text. In addition, (3) we revisit the notion of ontologies, previously defined in heuristic ways, to capture subsumption relations between terms. We make a clear distinction between local and global ontologies to capture the context of individual privacy policies, application domains, and privacy laws. Using a public dataset for evaluation, we show that POLIGRAPH-ER identifies 40% more collection statements than prior state-of-the-art, with 97% precision. In terms of applications, POLIGRAPH enables automated analysis of a corpus of privacy policies and allows us to: (1) reveal common patterns in the texts across different privacy policies, and (2) assess the correctness of the terms as defined within a privacy policy. We also apply POLIGRAPH to: (3) detect contradictions in a privacy policy, where we show false alarms by prior work, and (4) analyze the consistency of privacy policies and network traffic, where we identify significantly more clear disclosures than prior work. © 2023 32nd USENIX Security Symposium, USENIX Security 2023.

Closing borders, limited supply and manpower, and continuous changes in regulations challenged many logistics firms to innovate. This study analyzes 5098 abstracts of logistics articles using text mining to identify and to quantify the changes in logistics trends and innovations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if these trends and innovations were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate that (1) resiliency is an ongoing trend in logistics and has shown increasing importance during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) there appears to be acceleration in digitalization trend in logistics based on emerging focus on blockchain, Internet of Things, data, drones, robots, and unmanned vehicles during COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) there seems to be no evidence of acceleration in sustainability due to COVID-19 despite an observed shift in sustainability trends in terms of bioenergy and biofuel before COVID-19 pandemic to low-carbon, hydrogen and electric vehicles during COVID-19 pandemic. This paper recommends logistics firms, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), to analyze their readiness to adopt digitalization in terms of data, resources, and technology via, e.g., the use of a maturity scan, to contribute to sustainable and resilient logistics and to make sure that they remain competitive and future-proof. Policy makers can provide support to these SMEs by providing information, funding, and template solutions. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In order to prevent fraudulent activities and protect the interests of the insurers, it is crucial to have an efficient fraud detection system in place. Traditional methods of fraud detection rely on rule-based or statistical techniques, which may not be effective enough to detect increasingly complex and sophisticated fraudulent activities. The advent of deep learning techniques offers a promising solution to this problem. Many domains, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and image recognition, have already seen the practical use of deep learning. In order to detect fraud in insurance claims data, deep learning has significant potential because of its capacity to learn from and adapt to huge and complicated datasets. Gathering and examining a vast amount of data is the initial stage in developing an intelligent analysis system for fraud detection in insurance claims data. Financial transactions, policy information, claimant information, historical claims records, and information from external data sources like social media and public records can all be included in this data. Following collection, the data is cleaned and preprocessed to make it ready for additional analysis.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Information privacy revolves around the fundamental principle of notice and choice, namely the idea that users should be able to make informed decisions about what information about them can be collected and how it can be used. Internet users want control over their privacy, but their choices are often hidden in long and convoluted privacy policy documents. Moreover, little (if any) prior work has been done to detect the provision of choices in text. We address this challenge of enabling user choice by automatically identifying and extracting pertinent choice language in privacy policies. In particular, we present a two-stage architecture of classification models to identify opt-out choices in privacy policy text, labelling common varieties of choices with a mean F1 score of 0.735. Our techniques enable the creation of systems to help Internet users to learn about their choices, thereby effectuating notice and choice and improving Internet privacy. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It will lay a firm foundation for making full use of the great value hidden in the policy texts. [Method/ process] Based on the LDA model and attention mechanism, this paper proposes an applicable and integrated framework of policy text representation and classification by using the improved TextRank model and LDA model to enhance the vectorization of policy texts, and using CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model to extract the connotation features of policy texts, so as to improve the effect and accuracy of policy text classification. [Result/ conclusion] The experiment shows that compared with the single CNN model or BiLSTM model, the model proposed in this paper has a higher accuracy in policy text classification, and the accuracy can be further promoted by using topic model to enhance the representation effect of policy texts. Moreover, with the addition of attention mechanism, the proposed framework achieved the highest performance, with the F1 score of 91. 11%. [Limitations] The functional attributes and structural features of the policy texts are not fully explored and used, and the imbalance of the categories of the policy texts is not considered. © 2021 Information studies: Theory and Application.

However, the effectiveness of these policies has yet to be fully explored. This study aims to explore the practical policy configurational conditions for achieving a high level of OSC development. Design/methodology/approach: Data on policy configurational conditions and the OSC development level were collected from 28 provinces/municipalities in China using text mining. A mixed-method approach was used to conduct data analysis involving text analysis and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Text analysis was used to identify current policies with frequencies as independent variables and obtain the proportion of OSC projects in new construction projects as the dependent variable. QCA is employed to analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions of policy conditions for the high-level development of OSC by exploring the complex causal relationships between policy configurational conditions and the OSC development level. Findings: Nine policies are obtained from the current policy framework for promoting OSC development using text analysis: industry supports, land policies, presale policies, reputation rewards, regulation controls, tax incentives, floor area rewards, financial subsidies, and loan subsidies. Four policy configurational conditions are identified that can achieve a high development level of OSC: three incentive-driven policy conditions with industry supports, presale policies, tax incentives, and floor area rewards as the core conditions, and one compulsory-driven policy conditions with land policies, financial supports, and loan supports as the core conditions using fuzzy set QCA. Moreover, our study found that a single policy cannot achieve a high level of OSC development as a necessary condition, and the policy configurational conditions that lead to high and nonhigh levels of OSC development are asymmetrical. Research limitations/implications: The study did not test the policy’s dynamic effects on the OSC development. A longitudinal study will be conducted to further identify the impact of policy on OSC implementation. Practical implications: It provides policymakers with four practical policy configurational conditions to promote OSC development and guides policymakers to optimize effective policies considering the interaction effects of effective policies such as industry supports, presale policies, tax incentives, and floor area rewards instead of their net effects. Originality/value: It contributes to the existing literature concerning the effects of policy on emerging technology (i.e. OSC) promotion by elucidating configurative effects rather than net effects.

The complexity and scale of the problem require sophisticated tools and techniques to understand, model, and project future climate conditions. Artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to play a critical role in advancing our understanding of climate change and improving the accuracy of climate projections. ChatGPT can be used in a variety of ways to aid climate research, including in model parameterization, data analysis and interpretation, scenario generation, and model evaluation. This technology provides researchers and policy-makers with a powerful tool for generating and analyzing different climate scenarios based on a wide range of data inputs, and for improving the accuracy of climate projections. The author acknowledges asking chatGPT questions regarding its uses for Climate Change Research. Some of the uses that it states are possible now and some are potentials for the future.

Representative data from January to July 2024 were collected from Twitter and Weibo, and Python was used for analysis and visualization. Our findings reveal that public discussions about ChatGPT on Twitter and Weibo can be categorized into four consistent themes: technology, products, emotions and education. Among these, education emerged as the most frequently discussed theme. Sentiment analysis shows that both platforms are dominated by positive emotions, with Twitter having a slightly lower proportion (45.2%) compared to Weibo (54.5%). Negative (24.1%) and neutral (30.7%) sentiments on Twitter are marginally higher than those on Weibo (19.9% and 25.6%, respectively). These findings significantly update the previous studies, particularly those suggesting the Chinese public held predominantly negative attitudes toward ChatGPT. Our research also offers valuable insights for policymakers, global technology companies and educators. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. Objective: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (corona, 2019-nCov, and COVID-19), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. Results: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). Conclusions: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

In this paper we propose a fully automatic and semantic method for filtering/searching bibliographic data, which allows users to look for information by specifying simple keyword queries or document queries, i.e. by simply submitting existing documents to the system. The limitations of standard techniques, based on either syntactical text search and on manually assigned descriptors, are overcome by considering the semantics intrinsically associated to the document/query terms; to this aim, we exploit different kinds of external knowledge sources (both general and specific domain dictionaries or thesauri). The proposed techniques have been developed and successfully tested for agricultural bibliographic data, which play a central role to enable researchers and policy makers to retrieve related agricultural and scientific information by using the AGROVOC thesaurus. © The Author(s) 2015.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We collected three immigration-related datasets (i.e., social media posts, news media headlines, and policy documents covering the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic that also marked the last year of the Trump presidency) and applied manual coding, automated text analysis, and time series modeling to analyze the relationships. The results show that news media set the public agenda across Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube at the second level, with conservative media elevating travel-related discussion and liberal media driving border- and court-rulings-related discussion on those platforms. Compared to news media, the second-level agenda-setting effect of policy announcements was small and platform-specific. Among the three platforms, public discourse on YouTube was the most responsive to media and policy agendas. These findings advance second-level agenda-setting research, demonstrate partisan differences in news media’s impact, reveal the limited role of public policy, and provide a nuanced portrayal of cross-platform public discourse dynamics. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

One important development in advancing the empirical study of international re-lations (IR) theory, therefore, is the availability of machine-Analyzable speech data. A collection of fine-grained textual representations of states speeches in the context of an important international organization, such as the United Na-tions General Assembly (UNGA), is needed to understand the ideas, preferences, and values that states put forth in their statements. An especially promising use for such a corpus of texts would be to measure states preferences based on their statements. In an effort to add to the burgeoning field of text-As-data in IR, I present the UNGA Speech Corpus, a collection of over 34,000 speeches delivered by states in the UNGA from 1993 to 2018. I use it to im-prove on recent work that links text to preferences in IR by combining a structural topic model with locally trained word embeddings to estimate the policy positions of states on specific topics. I then show how these topic scorescan help scholars to improve their analyses of exigent international issues, such as global climate change governance. © 2024 Oxford University Press.

Although reinforcement learning methods can largely ease human effort, it’s challenging to design reward functions for real-world tasks, especially for high-dimensional robotic control, due to complex relationships among joints and tasks. Recent advancements large language models (LLMs) enable automatic reward function design. However, approaches evaluate reward functions by retraining policies from scratch placing an undue burden on the reward function, expecting it to be effective throughout the whole policy improvement process. We argue for a more practical strategy in robotic autonomy, focusing on refining existing policies with policy-dependent reward functions rather than a universal one. To this end, we propose a novel reward-policy co-evolution framework where the reward function and the learned policy benefit from each other’s progressive on-the-fly improvements, resulting in more efficient and higher-performing skill acquisition. Specifically, the reward evolution process translates the robot’s previous best reward function, descriptions of tasks and environment into text inputs. These inputs are used to query LLMs to generate a dynamic amount of reward function candidates, ensuring continuous improvement at each round of evolution. For policy evolution, our method generates new policy populations by hybridizing historically optimal and random policies. Through an improved Bayesian optimization, our approach efficiently and robustly identifies the most capable and plastic reward-policy combination, which then proceeds to the next round of co-evolution. Despite using less data, our approach demonstrates an average normalized improvement of 95.3% across various high-dimensional robotic skill learning tasks.

However, training such models requires expensive annotation of complex structures, which hinders their adoption. Learning to actively-learn (LTAL) is a recent paradigm for reducing the amount of labeled data by learning a policy that selects which samples should be labeled. In this work, we examine LTAL for learning semantic representations, such as QA-SRL. We show that even an oracle policy that is allowed to pick examples that maximize performance on the test set (and constitutes an upper bound on the potential of LTAL), does not substantially improve performance compared to a random policy. We investigate factors that could explain this finding and show that a distinguishing characteristic of successful applications of LTAL is the interaction between optimization and the oracle policy selection process. In successful applications of LTAL, the examples selected by the oracle policy do not substantially depend on the optimization procedure, while in our setup the stochastic nature of optimization strongly affects the examples selected by the oracle. We conclude that the current applicability of LTAL for improving data efficiency in learning semantic meaning representations is limited. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, there is much less knowledge on efficient and effective methods and practices for public sector citizensourcing in comparison with private sector crowd-sourcing, so extensive research is required in this area. This paper contributes to filling this research gap, by presenting an ICT-based method for ‘passive expert-sourcing’, with the latter term denoting the collection of policy relevant information, knowledge and ideas from experts, which aims at supporting policy making by the European Union (EU) by leveraging its large policy community. Its theoretical foundation is previous theoretical work on the relationships between democracy and technocracy, and also on policy networks. The main technological pillars of the proposed method are: EU policy experts’ profiling and reputation management, relevant documents’ opinion mining and relevance rating, and finally advanced visualized presentation of them. Finally, a first evaluation of the proposed method is presented, leading to encouraging results. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

By criticising the validity of the concept of multivectorism, this article supports the hypothesis of Uzbekistani foreign policy and interests being reimagined and reshaped by engagement with domestic, and external actors. After a reflection on the role of language and ideas in political analysis, I will employ a Structural Topic Model to test the hypothesis empirically. The findings will support the hypothesis and the use of big data to provide a less biased analysis of foreign policy trends. © 2023 Maracchione.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This dataset, spanning 21 years with daily granularity, provides a unique view of the evolving social network between licensed professionals and their affiliated firms in Hong Kong’s financial sector. Leveraging large language models, we classify firms (e.g., asset managers, banks) and infer the likely nationality and gender of employees based on their names. This application enhances the dataset by adding rich demographic and organizational context, enabling more precise network analysis. Our preliminary findings reveal key structural features, offering new insights into the dynamics of Hong Kong’s financial landscape. We release the structured dataset to enable further research, establishing a foundation for future studies that may inform recruitment strategies, policy-making, and risk management in the financial industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Theoretically, parties may either adapt their ideological “core” to signal commitment or merely attribute nativist ideas to secondary issue areas to signal general responsiveness. Drawing on Austrian, German, and Swiss manifestos for over two decades and establishing a novel dictionary to assess parties’ use of nativism, we find that while previous studies showing right-wing parties compete with RRPs using nativism in the same domains are correct, the strategic choices around this competition are more complex. How much commitment to nativist ideas parties show depends on whether radical right parties use the same domains to construct their nativist claims. For research on party competition, this means that more attention should be paid to how rather than if parties “engage” with their rivals. © The Author(s) 2022.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study employs the structural topic model (STM) to analyze 139 AI policies from China, the European Union (EU), and the United States (US), three key actors in global AI governance. The analysis identifies 13 primary topics within AI policy frameworks, which are categorized into “research and application” (e.g., talent education, industrial application), “social impact” (e.g., technological risk, human rights), and “government role” (e.g., government responsibility, management agency). Notably, “government role” receives the most attention, while “social impact” is the least emphasized. The findings reveal that China prioritizes “research and application,” the EU emphasizes “social impact,” and the US focuses on “government role,” while all three demonstrate a growing emphasis on institutional systems, human rights, and scientific research. This study provides a comprehensive policy framework for AI governance, highlights the strategic priorities of China, the EU, and the US, and introduces an innovative method for policy text analysis. Moreover, it underscores the need for AI governance to balance industry development with ethical imperatives, foster comprehensive technological ecosystems, and prioritize public participation and international cooperation. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Navigating the complexities of public health communication during this crisis has emerged as a paramount challenge for both governmental institutions and media entities. In response to this quandary, we executed an extensive analysis of 929 official Chinese reports pertaining to COVID-19 on social media platforms, spanning from 7 November 2022, to 7 January 2023. Utilizing the sophisticated methodology of Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN), we discerned three overarching frameworks (Social Health Resources, Official Public Health Actions, and Dissemination of Health Knowledge) and nine salient themes (Medical Infrastructure, Collective Public Health Initiatives, Epidemiological Trajectories, Governmental Health Interventions, Temporary Recesses, Public Health Regulations, Community-Based Public Health, Medical Supply Distribution, and Health Information Dissemination). Moreover, by juxtaposing media coverage before and after the Chinese government’s adjustment in epidemic policy, we unveiled substantial disparities in the framing and thematic foci among various tiers and genres of media outlets. Our findings illuminate the intricate nature of public health reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic and underscore the necessity for a judicious appraisal of diverse factors. © 2024 Asian Media Information and Communication Centre.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An Analysis of Online Reviews\n                    ABSTRACT: In this paper, we aim to explore the impact of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic on the global tourism industry and the changes in users' online reviews of listings on the Airbnb platform in this context. As a result of the outbreak, countries have introduced travel restriction policies to limit the movement of people and control the spread of the epidemic, which has dealt a severe blow to the global tourism industry. We want to provide an in-depth study of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the tourism industry, as well as to explore the changes in the focus and attention of users on the travel experience. This is informative for tourism industry practitioners and policy makers to help better understand market demand and develop more rational policies. We selected online reviews on the Airbnb platform to explore the industry impact of the epidemic. Through topic modeling and sentiment analysis, this paper investigates the changes in users' discussion focus and attention level before, during and after the epidemic, and explores the reasons for them. The results show that the number of non-local visitors plummeted during the epidemic, while visitors paid more attention to topics related to environmental hygiene and personal health. In addition, this paper finds that user reviews have a very clear positive bias. From the triple perspective of platform, hosts, and users, this paper explores the reasons behind the phenomenon.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Use said pipeline to analyze mental health trends on subreddits frequented by pregnant women and report on interesting insights that could be helpful for policy-makers, clinicians, etc. Materials and methods: We used pretrained transformer-based models to build a natural language processing pipeline that can automatically detect depressed pregnant women on social media and carry out topic modeling to detect their concerns. Results: We detected depressed posts by pregnant women on Reddit and validated the performance of the depression classification model by carrying out topic modeling to reveal that depressive topics were detected. The proportion of potentially depressed surprisingly reduced during the pandemic (2020 and 2021). Queries related to antidepressants, such as Zoloft, and potential ways of managing mental health dominated discourse before the pandemic (2018 and 2019), whereas queries about pelvic pain and associated stress dominated the discourse during the pandemic. Discussion and Conclusion: Supportive online communities could be a factor in alleviating stress related to the pandemic, hence the reduction in the proportion of depressed users during the pandemic. Stress during the pandemic has been associated with pelvic pain among pregnant women, and this trend is confirmed through topic modeling of depressive posts during the pandemic.  © 2023 The Author(s).

The author’s stance could be in “favor” or “against” the topic under consideration. A myriad amount of data is being accumulated via various social media platforms. This work considers the Kannada–English code-mixed aspect of social media text. The corpus was collected based on various trending topics such as “Bengaluru molestation,” “currency ban”, etc. using particular word phrases. The user comments on social media platform Facebook was used to collect the corpus. The collected dataset was represented using different techniques such as bag of tricks, word embedding like Word2vec and GloVe, and pre-trained embeddings. These representations were further used in combination with various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The results for various combinations are listed. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This also includes informing users about any choices they might have regarding such data practices. However, few users read these often long privacy policies; and those who do have difficulty understanding them, because they are written in convoluted and ambiguous language. A promising approach to help overcome this situation revolves around semi-automatically annotating policies, using combinations of crowdsourcing, machine learning and natural language processing. In this article, we introduce PrivOnto, a semantic framework to represent annotated privacy policies. PrivOnto relies on an ontology developed to represent issues identified as critical to users and/or legal experts. PrivOnto has been used to analyze a corpus of over 23,000 annotated data practices, extracted from 115 privacy policies of US-based companies. We introduce a collection of 57 SPARQL queries to extract information from the PrivOnto knowledge base, with the dual objective of (1) answering privacy questions of interest to users and (2) supporting researchers and regulators in the analysis of privacy policies at scale. We present an interactive online tool using PrivOnto to help users explore our corpus of 23,000 annotated data practices. Finally, we outline future research and open challenges in using semantic technologies for privacy policy analysis. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Methods: After collecting nurse-related news articles published before and after ‘the Thanks to You Challenge’ campaign (between December 31, 2019, and July 15, 2020), keywords were extracted via preprocessing. A three-step method keyword analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, and keyword network analysis was used to examine the text and the structure of the selected news articles. Results: Top 30 keywords with similar occurrences were collected before and after the campaign. The five dominant topics before the campaign were: Pandemic, infection of medical staff, local transmission, medical resources, and return of overseas Koreans. After the campaign, the topics ‘infection of medical staff’ and ‘return of overseas Koreans’ disappeared, but ‘the Thanks to You Challenge’ emerged as a dominant topic. A keyword network analysis revealed that the word of nurse was linked with keywords like thanks and campaign, through the word of sacrifice. These words formed interrelated domains of ‘the Thanks to You Challenge’ topic. Conclusion: The findings of this study can provide useful information for understanding various issues and social perspectives on COVID-19 nursing. The major themes of news reports lagged behind the real problems faced by nurses in COVID-19 crisis. While the press tends to focus on heroism and whole society, issues and policies mutually beneficial to public and nursing need to be further explored and enhanced by nurses. © 2021 Korean Society of Nursing Science.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In the process of grouping the thesis title automatically it is hoped that it can help policy makers such as the head of the study program. In this case the researcher uses fuzzy c-means algorithm which can group data in clusters so that the data of a cluster has a high level of equality with each other. In the application there is a text mining method which is a development of data mining that can be applied to overcome thesis grouping problems or research data. The result is a web that can classify research data / thesis data with a total accuracy of 96%. This number is the accuracy given based on the performance of the fuzzy c-means algorithm on the system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, such strong ability relies on a huge amount of computing resources, which makes it difficult to deploy LLMs on computing resource-constrained platforms. Currently, LLMs process each token equivalently, but we argue that not every word is equally important. Some words should not be allocated excessive computing resources, particularly for dispensable terms in simple questions. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic inference paradigm for LLMs, namely D-LLMs, which adaptively allocate computing resources in token processing. We design a dynamic decision module for each transformer layer that decides whether a network unit should be executed or skipped. Moreover, we tackle the issue of adapting D-LLMs to real-world applications, specifically concerning the missing KV-cache when layers are skipped. To overcome this, we propose a simple yet effective eviction policy to exclude the skipped layers from subsequent attention calculations. The eviction policy not only enables D-LLMs to be compatible with prevalent applications but also reduces considerable storage resources. Experimentally, D-LLMs show superior performance, in terms of computational cost and KV storage utilization. It can reduce up to 45% computational cost and KV storage on Q&A, summarization, and math solving tasks, 50% on commonsense reasoning tasks. © 2024 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We study how specialization translates in the phenomenon of “epistemic capture” in democratic politics. We combine topic modeling, network analysis and community detection to complement lexical “distant reading” approaches the history of political ideas with a network-based analysis that illuminates political-intellectual processes. We demonstrate how the breadth of political debate declines as its specialist depth increases. To study this transformation, we take a multi-level approach. At the (institutional) macro-level, network modularity shows an increase in the modularity of topic linkage networks, indicating growing specialization post-1960, linked to institutional reforms. At the (political) meso-level, we similarly observe specialization in node neighborhood stability, but also variation as the consequence of ideological and party political change. Lastly, micro-level analysis reveals persistent thematic communities tied to increasingly stable groups of individuals, revealing how policy domains and politicians are captured in ossified specialisms. As such, this study provides new insights into the development of twentieth-century political debate and emergent tensions between pluralism and specialism. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This has highlighted the need to reduce harvest and post-harvest losses in the most vulnerable low to middle-income countries. The research and international community have actively engaged on the conceptual frameworks underpinning FLW, on the measurement approaches and the policy interventions to reduce FLW. Critical information gaps and data needs are evident. This paper using as a base the main conceptual frameworks proposed for measurement of FLW and existing quantitative evidence, attempts to sketch out a number of steps for gathering internationally comparable policy-relevant information. It presents quantitative evidence from a meta-analysis based on a machine learning text-mining tool, which is used to reassess a global percentage of losses with an emphasis on low and middle-income countries. Findings show that: i) losses for perishable crops, such as fruits and vegetables, display a median of 6.4 percent compared to 2.7–3.8 percent for other crops; ii) losses are higher in low-middle income regions, with 10–15 percent median losses, for example, for fruits and vegetables, compared to 4–7 percent for Europe and North America; iii) significant information gaps remain and the comparison of results across countries or even between sectors within them remains challenging. Acknowledging that some of these gaps are the result of insufficient coordination between different initiatives, this paper proposes operational frameworks to improve synergies and coordination in the measurement of FLW, in support of stakeholders’ decision making for reducing FLW. © 2020\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For a robot to perform tasks such as pick and place, understanding both what the objects are and where they are located is crucial. While the former has been extensively discussed in the literature that uses the large language model to enrich the text descriptions, the latter remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce the Object-Centric Instruction Augmentation (OCI) framework to augment highly semantic and information-dense language instruction with position cues. We utilize a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to weave knowledge of object locations into natural language instruction, thus aiding the policy network in mastering actions for versatile manipulation. Additionally, we present a feature reuse mechanism to integrate the vision-language features from off-the-shelf pre-trained MLLM into policy networks. Through a series of simulated and real-world robotic tasks, we demonstrate that robotic manipulator imitation policies trained with our enhanced instructions outperform those relying solely on traditional language instructions. © 2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In particular, sentiment analysis classifies a text into positive, negative, or neutral. It does not capture the state of mind of an individual like happiness, anger, and fear. Therefore, emotion detection plays an important role in user-generated content for capturing the state of mind. Moreover, researchers adopted traditional machine learning and deep learning models to capture emotions from the text. Recently, transformers-based architectures achieve better results in various natural language processing tasks. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based emotion detection system, which uses context-dependent features and a one-cycle learning rate policy for a better understanding of emotions from the text. We evaluate the proposed emotion detection model using error matrix, learning curve, precision, recall, F1-score, and their micro and macro averages. Our results indicate that the system achieves a 6 % accuracy over existing models. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, its resource-intensive nature necessitates strategic integration of renewable energy and optimization strategies to mitigate environmental impacts. This review is critical as it systematically examines the transformative role of metaverse technologies in energy systems, identifying their potential to optimize efficiency, foster innovation, and align with global sustainability objectives. This paper employs a rigorous methodology, integrating the PRISMA framework, machine learning-based BERTopic modeling, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) mapping algorithms to provide a structured synthesis of current research. The review is based on 4951 documents from the Scopus database, refined through a three-stage selection process, yielding a final dataset of 508 relevant publications. Through this analysis, six key themes emerge where metaverse technologies significantly impact energy systems: (1) advancing sustainability in transport, manufacturing, and nuclear power, supporting SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure); (2) enabling sustainable energy transitions through smart grids and AI-driven models, aligning with SDG 7's goal of universal clean energy access and SDG 13 (Climate Action), which integrates climate resilience into energy strategies. Additionally, innovations in battery technologies and immersive solutions for nuclear sustainability further demonstrate the metaverse's role in driving sustainable energy applications. This study makes a novel contribution by advancing the understanding of the metaverse-energy sustainability nexus through a systematic, data-driven approach, distinguishing itself from prior reviews by integrating topic modeling and SDG mapping. The findings highlight the need for strategic adoption, policy frameworks, and investment in sustainable design to ensure the metaverse's positive impact on global energy systems. Future research should focus on advancing digital twins, immersive technologies, and renewable energy integration to enhance efficiency, equity, and resilience in energy applications. © 2025 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Some might induce harsh measures, such as a lockdown. Following a long, harsh lockdown, the recession forces policymakers to rethink reopening. To provide an effective strategy, here we propose a control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals’ propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision-makers to find optimal lockdown and exit strategies for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized. We use the public sentiment information during the pandemic to determine the percentage of individuals with high-risk behavior and the percentage of individuals with low-risk behavior. Hence, we propose an online platform using fear-sentiment information to estimate the personal protective equipment (PPE) burn rate overtime for the entire population. In addition, a study of a COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is performed to validate our model and its results. The total social cost reduces by 18% compared with a control strategy where susceptible individuals are assumed to be homogeneous. We also reduce the total social costs by 26% and 22% compared to other strategies that consider the health-care cost or the social performance cost, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, these advancements come with substantial energy costs. The training and deployment of LLMs require extensive computational resources, leading to escalating energy consumption and environmental impacts. This paper explores the driving factors behind the high energy demands of LLMs through the lens of the Technology Environment Organization (TEO) framework, assesses their ecological implications, and proposes sustainable strategies for mitigating these challenges. Specifically, we explore algorithmic improvements, hardware innovations, renewable energy adoption, and decentralized approaches to AI training and deployment. Our findings contribute to the literature on sustainable AI and provide actionable insights for industry stakeholders and policymakers. © 2024 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The first concerns how we think about the training of such models - in particular, whether the creators or owners of the data that are scraped(lawfully or unlawfully, with or without permission) should be compensated for that use. The second question revolves around the ownership of the output generated by AI, which is continually improving in quality and scale. These topics fall in the realm of intellectual property, a legal framework designed to incentivize and reward only human creativity and innovation. For some years, however, Britain has maintained a distinct category for computer-generatedoutputs; on the input issue, the EU and Singapore have recently introduced exceptions allowing for text and data mining or computational data analysis of existing works. This article explores the broader implications of these policy choices, weighing the advantages of reducing the cost of content creation and the value of expertise against the potential risk to various careers and sectors of the economy, which might be rendered unsustainable. Lessons may be found in the music industry, which also went through a period of unrestrained piracy in the early digital era, epitomized by the rise and fall of the file-sharing service Napster. Similar litigation and legislation may help navigate the present uncertainty, along with an emerging market for legitimatemodels that respect the copyright of humans and are clear about the provenance of their own creations.  © 2024 The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Creating sufficient technological diversity among its alternatives is important for the long-term success of nanotechnologies, as well as for other emerging technologies. Diversity prevents early lock-in, facilitates recombinant innovation, increases resilience, and allows market growth. Creation of new technological alternatives usually takes place in innovation projects in which public and private partners often collaborate. Currently, there is little empirical evidence about which characteristics of innovation projects influence diversity. In this paper we study the influence of characteristics of EU-funded nanotechnology projects on the creation of technological diversity. In addition to actor diversity and the network of the project, we also include novel variables that have a plausible influence on diversity creation: the degree of multi-disciplinarity of the project and the size of the joint knowledge base of project partners. We apply topic modelling (Latent Dirichlet allocation) as a novel method to categorize technological alternatives. Using an ordinal logistic regression model, our results show that the largest contribution to diversity comes from the multi-disciplinary nature of a project. The joint knowledge base of project partners and the geographical distance between them were positively associated with technological diversity creation. In contrast, the number and diversity of actors and the degree of clustering showed a negative association with technological diversity creation. These results extend current micro-level explanations of how the diversity of an emerging technology is created. The contribution of this study could also be helpful for policy makers to influence the level of diversity in a technological field, and hence to contribute to survival of emerging technologies. © 2017, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper reveals policy gaps hindering SI-FLR approach in Brazil and offers recommendations to leverage its advancement, incorporating insights from the Brazilian context and international best practices and experiences. Brazilian policy documents in force in 2022 were analysed through the lens of five conceptual bridges of the SI-FLR framework. Applying a deductive approach and text-mining techniques, 91 SI-FLR-enabling policy instruments were identified, and the governance structures ruling them were mapped. Four major gaps emerged: (1) a lack of political will for the environmental agenda; (2) poor political coordination, resulting from the fragmentation of the mapped governance structures; (3) a missing landscape governance approach, reflecting the disconnection between these structures, restoration activities and value chains associated; and (4) a citizen science gap in innovation policy, highlighting the insufficiency of instruments promoting collaboration between public research and innovation institutions and local communities to address local social challenges. We conclude with two strategic recommendations: (1) structuring a National Landscape Restoration Governance System dedicated to improving policy coordination and landscape governance and (2) developing a regulatory instrument bringing citizen science to the research and innovation policy, increasing collaborative partnerships, innovation policy instruments and encouraging socioecological innovators. These recommendations represent a first step towards leveraging SI in the Brazilian FLR effort and may inspire other countries to expand the role of social innovators in developing nature-based solutions. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Data were collected via Text mining; frequency, association, and sentiment analysis using the social big data analysis service, (known as “Some-Trend”), 2 months before and after December 16, 2021, when the vaccine pass was announced. The total number of search results was 4899 occurrences of the keywords using “eating alone” and “Hon-bab” (Korean abbreviation for eating alone). During the week of December 16, the frequency was the highest (770 occurrences). Compared to the weeks before the announcement sentiment analysis shows that words including “Reject,” “Discrimination,” and “Uncomfortable,” among others, either newly appeared or increased in frequency. And also, the percentage of positive words decreased from 54.5% to 34% and that of negative words increased from 30.2% to 43.3%. The introduction of the vaccine pass has raised negative public interest, particularly regarding the policy of unvaccinated people forcefully restricted to eat alone. Accordingly, this study showed that the vaccine policy had not gain positive perception of the public. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In an effort to improve public understanding, we curated a corpus of 543 misinformation pieces whittled down to 243 unique misinformation narratives along with third party proofs debunking these stories. Building upon previous applications of topic modeling to COVID-19 related material, we developed a tool leveraging topic modeling to create a chronological visualization of these stories. From our corpus of misinformation stories, this tool has shown to accurately represent the ground truth reported by our curator team. This highlights some of the misinformation narratives unique to the COVID-19 pandemic and provides a quick method to monitor and assess misinformation diffusion, enabling policymakers to identify themes to focus on for communication campaigns. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

Because of its importance, lots of researches have come out. Recently, the neural generative models have shown their impressive ability as the core of chatbot, while it cannot scale well when directly applied to medical conversation due to the lack of medical-specific knowledge. To address the limitation, a scalable medical knowledge-assisted mechanism (MKA) is proposed in this paper. The mechanism is aimed at assisting general neural generative models to achieve better performance on the medical conversation task. The medical-specific knowledge graph is designed within the mechanism, which contains 6 types of medical-related information, including department, drug, check, symptom, disease, and food. Besides, the specific token concatenation policy is defined to effectively inject medical information into the input data. Evaluation of our method is carried out on two typical medical datasets, MedDG and MedDialog-CN. The evaluation results demonstrate that models combined with our mechanism outperform original methods in multiple automatic evaluation metrics. Besides, MKA-BERT-GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance.  © 2021 Ke Liang et al.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In particular, we investigate how objectives vary across central and local Five-Year Plans (FYPs), in terms of industry preferences, and also compare such objectives with those included in China’s landmark industrial policy, “Made in China 2025.” Notwithstanding China’s centralization of policy planning, we find relevant sectoral differences between central and provincial planning and key industrial policy documents. Secondly, we look at how decisions are made in the realm of China’s industrial policy (“deeds”). To this end, we assess empirically why certain companies are selected under the most recent grand industrial policy strategy, the 10,000 Little Giants, a spin-off of “Made in China 2025.” Out of the key four criteria of selection (i.e., “words”), one is missed in most cases, namely the concentration of the business activity in the relevant sector. Secondly, the intensity of R&D is only significant in the most recent batches of selected companies. For the last two (revenue generation and leverage), there is no noticeable difference between the selected companies and the others. Our results point to the complexities in conducting industrial policy in China as words and deeds do not necessarily align. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Emotional responses to scientific findings often play a pivotal role in these core issues. When there is too much diversity of opinion on topics of science, emotions flare up and give rise to conflict. This conflict threatens positive outcomes for research. Emotions have the power to shape how people process new information. They can color the public's understanding of science, motivate policy positions, even change lives. And yet little work has been done to evaluate the public's emotional response to science using quantitative methods. In this paper, we use a dataset of responses to scholarly articles on Facebook to analyze the dynamics of emotional valence, intensity, and diversity. We present a novel way of weighting click-based reactions that increases their comprehensibility, and use these weighted reactions to develop new metrics of aggregate emotional responses. We use our metrics along with LDA topic models and statistical testing to investigate how users' emotional responses differ from one scientific topic to another. We find that research articles related to gender, genetics, or agricultural/environmental sciences elicit significantly different emotional responses from users than other research topics. We also find that there is generally a positive response to scientific research on Facebook, and that articles generating a positive emotional response are more likely to be widely shared-a conclusion that contradicts previous studies of other social media platforms. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These legal documents govern the exchange, access, and dissemination of farm data and are expected to provide legal protection against misuse of data. Despite their significant influence on farm data processing and governance, there is limited understanding of the content of farm data license agreements and standards for drafting them. Although online privacy policy content has been extensively studied, farm data agreements’ evaluation and analysis have been overlooked. This study aims to investigate the structure, content, and transparency of farm data licenses. We collected 141 agricultural terms of use agreements and used natural language processing methods such as keyword and keyphrase analysis to perform text feature analysis, Flesch Readability Ease Score and Flesch Grade Level readability analysis, transparency analysis, and content analysis to gain insight into common data practices adopted by the agriculture technology providers. We also manually reviewed these agreements to validate the results and strengthen the observations. The findings show that data agreements are long, complex, and difficult to read and comprehend. The results suggest that 95% of the agreements fall under the difficult-to-read category and close to 75% of the policies require university-level education to understand the content. Furthermore, it is noted that some of the data management practices are not given adequate attention and are not as frequently mentioned in the agreements as expected. Finally, our analysis enabled us to provide recommendations on the content of farm data license agreements and strategies to improve them. © 2023 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For each modification recorded, DiCo provides additional information on the microstructural level, such as the linguistic labels included in the article where the change occurred. Based on a manual comparison of the successive editions of a given dictionary, DiCo can be the starting point for quantitative and qualitative metalexicographical studies. The description of the diachronic evolution of a dictionary and the comparison of different dictionaries reveal that not only does lexicographical change reflect language evolution, but that the content of a dictionary is also bound to the editorial policy of a publishing house, itself subject to change. Given the scarcity of information on this topic provided to the general public by French publishing houses, a resource facilitating metalexicographical investigations is particularly helpful. In addition to enabling a better understanding of French dictionaries, DiCo may be useful to linguists interested in lexicology and diachronic and diatopic variation. Finally, it might also prove useful for building lexicons for natural language processing. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

While lung cancer screening is crucial for improving early diagnosis and survival rates, it faces multiple challenges in China, including public awareness, limited medical resources, high costs, follow-up management, technical capabilities, coverage, and policy funding. The rapid development of generative pretrained transformer (GPT) technology presents new opportunities for lung cancer screening. It can enhance health education, optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, improve coverage, strengthen follow-up management, and advance technical capabilities. Furthermore, it can help improve policy and financial support while fostering collaboration among the government, medical institutions, and various sectors of society to overcome these obstacles. This collaboration would facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, ultimately reducing the mortality rate. However, several challenges remain in the practical application of these technologies, including the need for technological innovation, policy support, and ethical considerations. Multidisciplinary cooperation is needed to overcome these challenges. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The World Health Organization recommends using the ICD-10 system to standardize death certificate coding, a task often supported by semi-automated systems. This paper assesses the effectiveness of BERT and Mistral language models in automating this process, focusing particularly on their handling of varied instance densities per ICD code, ranging from 1 (simulating the introduction of a new code) to 100 (representing well-established codes). Through extensive comparative experiments, we find that the finetuned Mistral model substantially outperforms BERT, especially in scenarios with limited data. Mistral's higher effectiveness, even with limited data from less commonly used codes, highlight its potential to significantly enhance automated coding systems.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, for discrete outputs such as language, optimizing GANs remains an open problem with many instabilities, as no gradient can be properly back-propagated from the discriminator output to the generator parameters. An alternative is to learn the generator network via reinforcement learning, using the discriminator signal as a reward, but such a technique suffers from moving rewards and vanishing gradient problems. Finally, it often falls short compared to direct maximum-likelihood approaches. In this paper, we introduce Generative Cooperative Networks, in which the discriminator architecture is cooperatively used along with the generation policy to output samples of realistic texts for the task at hand. We give theoretical guarantees of convergence for our approach, and study various efficient decoding schemes to empirically achieve state-of-the-art results in two main NLG tasks.

In this exploratory study, we examine subscription trends on three political sub-forums on Reddit during the 2016 US presidential elections:/The_Donald,/SandersForPresident, and/HillaryClinton. As a theoretical framework, we draw from work on online communities’ group identity and cohesion. Concretely, we investigate how subscription dynamics relate to positive, negative and neutral news events occurring during the election cycle. We classify news events using a sentiment analysis of event-related news headlines. We observe that users who supported Sanders displayed no consolidation of support for Clinton after she won the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Secondly, we show that negative news events affected Sanders and Clintons subscription trends negatively, while showing no effect for Donald Trump. This gives empirical credence to Trump’s controversial claim that he could “stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any voters”. We offer a number of explanations for the observed phenomena: the nature of the content of the three subreddits, their cultural dynamics, and changing dynamics of partisanship. We posit that the ‘death of expertise’ expresses itself on Reddit as a switch in persuasion tactics from a policy-based to an emotions-based approach, and that group members’ agreement on policy proved a weak marker for online communities’ group identity and cohesion. We also claim that strong partisanship coupled with weak party affiliation among Millennials contributed to the low levels of Democratic support consolidation after Clinton won the nomination. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To tackle these issues, we propose LLM4SAC, a novel algorithm that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) framework to achieve USV autonomous docking tasks. LLM4SAC addresses these issues by leveraging the advanced contextual understanding and adaptive decision-making capabilities of LLMs. By providing high-level, context-specific guidance, LLMs enhance the RL agent's ability to interpret complex environmental data and adjust strategies in real time. This reduces the reliance on extensive simulated training datasets and increases the robustness and accuracy of the system under actual operating conditions. The dynamic request policy further refines the system's efficiency, querying LLMs only when necessary to minimize computational demands and interaction costs. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that LLM4SAC significantly improves docking success rates, reduces computational costs, and enhances adaptability to dynamic conditions.

The objective of this study is to know which classification algorithm performs better on two domains of text with different length. We have applied six machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, random forest, Naïve Bayes, and decision tree) and compared them on the basis f-score, precision, recall, and accuracy. In the IMDb dataset, logistic regression performs better among all and gives the highest accuracy of 96.3% and f-score of 80.6%. The second highest is achieved with Naïve Bayes with 95.89 and 80.05% f-score. Naïve Bayes gives the highest accuracy of 81.08% and an f-score of 42.45% in the STS-Gold dataset. The second highest is achieved with logistic regression giving an accuracy of 80.09 and 41.52% f-score. We found that logistic regression and Naïve Bayes are performing better among all the algorithms on both datasets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The difficulty of detecting, classifying, and quantifying emotions in text in any form are addressed in this study. We consider English text collected from social media sites such as Twitter and various Kaggle datasets that can provide information useful in a variety of ways, particularly opinion mining. However, analysing and categorising text based on emotions is a difficult task and might be thought of as a more advanced kind of Sentiment Analysis. This work provides a system for categorising text into three types of emotions: positive, negative, and neutral. This analysis can be utilized by authorities to better understand people's mental health and to make appropriate policy decisions to combat the coronavirus, which is hurting the world's social well-being and economy. © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The consequences of misinformation can be profound, affecting public opinion, policy decisions, and even public health. Therefore, detecting and reducing the spread of fake news is an essential issue that requires reliable and precise solutions. Historically, the field of fake news detection has witnessed notable advancements, but several shortcomings have persisted. Many earlier approaches struggled to attain the requisite levels of accuracy. Another formidable obstacle that these earlier approaches encountered was the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the tactics employed by those who spread fake news. They employ sensational language, which uses phrases with high emotional content to attract readers and elicit a strong emotional response. Recognizing these deficiencies, we present an innovative solution that leverages the state-of-the-art RoBERTa model and a meticulously modified deep neural network architecture. Our approach stands out by not only recognizing the urgency of the fake news detection problem but also by proposing architectural enhancements. It specifically targets the inadequacies of prior methods. We introduce attention mechanisms designed to identify subtle cues indicative of misinformation. The feature extraction techniques capture the nuanced patterns that fake news articles often follow. These architectural refinements make our model extremely effective and achieve an accuracy of 99.76%. The comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our RoBERTa-based model consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art fake news detection models, emphasizing the crucial role of advanced language models in combating misinformation.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The actualization of “dual carbon” targets is contingent upon the foundation of robust fiscal policies, and meticulous assessments of policy documentation are instrumental in reflecting the foreseen efficacies of these measures. The study employs text mining techniques to articulate evaluative benchmarks for fiscal policy scripts under the “dual carbon” framework and engages a bidirectional fixed-effects model to corroborate the linkage between fiscal policy implements and carbon emissions, alongside a holistic appraisal using the PMC-CRITIC index model. The research corroborates that fiscal instruments, such as tax reliefs and green fiscal transfers, significantly encourage the diminution of carbon emissions. The average PMC-CRITIC index of the policy specimens assessed is 0.62, indicating a level that is permissible yet indicating potential for further refinement. Of the reviewed policy samples, the preponderance adheres to satisfactory thresholds, with an ensuing tier demonstrating exceptional policy. The average evaluations of policy timeliness, nature, and evaluation are laudable, notwithstanding the necessity for ameliorations in the precision of policy objectives, the credibility of the policy objects, and the targeted applicability of policy tools. Accordingly, in the trajectory of impending policy development, there should be an amplification of the collaborative mechanisms both horizontally among sundry tiers of local governance and vertically across disparate bureaucratic strata, the adoption of a systemized approach to elucidate and resolve the fundamental dissonances in actualizing “dual carbon” objectives. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Authors from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, and China discuss takeovers in the context of China as a rising power in the global M&A market and re-examine takeover as an efficient method for corporate competition, consolidation, and restructuring. China has come to embrace takeovers as a market practice and is seeking directions for further reforms of its law, regulatory model, and banking system in order to compete with other economic powers. Yet, China is at a very different economic development stage and has different legal and political structures. State-owned enterprises dominate the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets - a very different landscape from UK and European exchanges. Researchers and policy makers are currently developing options in response to needs for reform. Recently, China has also announced the opening of its financial markets to foreign ownership. This book reflects on the UK and European models and focuses on the policy choices for China to transform its capital market. The book is of interest to postgraduate students and researchers (LLM, PhD, postdocs), law and management/finance academics, and policy makers. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Although the science of data mining and machine learning has done much to address the problem of these tools, their scope is still limited regarding the management of human language which has inherent uncertainty and ambiguity. This research seeks to address this gap by illustrating how to apply a machine learning tool in a way that embraces the so-called uncertainty neutrality using the orange data analysis tool for analysis of visualized data. It is also important to note in the research that the combination of neutral and intelligent analysis with using applications such as orange increases the efficiency of sentiment classification and expands the theoretical scope of sentiment data analysis. Their findings underscore that this perspective seeks to illuminate details which other methods tend to ignore and hence offer a much more nuanced understanding of human cognition. Practically, this research presents an efficient paradigm as the new framework can be employed in market intelligence, evaluation of public policy and intelligent interface design, among others. As a result, this research does not only contribute to the body of knowledge within the profession of data science but also explores new dimensions in understanding human cognition. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

However, it is necessary to conduct extensive research in order to develop advanced methodologies and practices of social media exploitation in government for the above purposes. This chapter contributes in this direction by presenting a methodology for the efficient exploitation of multiple Web 2.0 social media by government agencies in order to broaden and enhance e-participation. It is based on a central platform which enables posting content and deploying micro web applications (‘Policy Gadgets’-Padgets) to multiple popular Web 2.0 social media, and also collecting users’ interactions with them (e.g. views, comments, ratings) in an efficient manner using their application programming interfaces (API). These interaction data undergo various levels of processing, such as calculation of useful analytics, opinion mining and simulation modelling, in order to provide effective support to public decision and policy makers. A first evaluation of the proposed methodology in a series of pilot applications gave positive results as to its capabilities and value, and at the same time revealed some critical preconditions for its successful application. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Predictions of the PM2.5 concentration must be accurate for pollution reduction strategies and policy actions to succeed. This research article presents a novel approach for forecasting PM2.5 pollution in Delhi by combining a pre-trained CNN model with a transformer-based model called CATALYST (Convolutional and Transformer model for Air Quality Forecasting). This proposed strategy uses a mixture of the two models. To derive attributes of the PM2.5 timeline of data, a pre-existing CNN model is utilized to transform the data into visual representations, which are analyzed subsequently. The CATALYST model is trained to predict future PM2.5 pollution levels using a sliding window training approach on extracted features. The model is utilized for analyzing temporal dependencies in PM2.5 time-series data. This model incorporates the advancements in the transformer-based architecture initially designed for natural language processing applications. CATALYST combines positional encoding with the Transformer architecture to capture intricate patterns and variations resulting from diverse meteorological, geographical, and anthropogenic factors. In addition, an innovative approach is suggested for building input–output couples, intending to address the problem of missing or partial data in environmental time-series datasets while ensuring that all training data blocks are comprehensive. On a PM2.5 dataset, we analyze the proposed CATALYST model and compare its performance with other standard time-series forecasting approaches, such as ARIMA and LSTM. The outcomes of the experiments demonstrate that the suggested model works better than conventional methods and is a potential strategy for accurately forecasting PM2.5 pollution. The applicability of CATALYST to real-world scenarios can be tested by running more experiments on real-world datasets. This can help develop efficient pollution mitigation measures, impacting public health and environmental sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, existing retrieval-augmented approaches face challenges in addressing diverse queries and documents, particularly for medical knowledge queries, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel plug- and-play LLM-based retrieval method called Self-Rewarding Tree Search (SeRTS) based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a self-rewarding paradigm. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the effectiveness of tree search, SeRTS boosts the zero-shot performance of retrieving high-quality and informative results for RAG. We further enhance retrieval performance by fine-tuning LLMs with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) objectives using the trajectories collected by SeRTS as feedback. Controlled experiments using the BioASQ-QA dataset with GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLama2-7b demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the BM25 retriever and surpasses the strong baseline of self-reflection in both efficiency and scalability. Moreover, SeRTS generates higher-quality feedback for PPO training than self-reflection. Our proposed method effectively adapts LLMs to document retrieval tasks, enhancing their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents for RAG in the context of medical knowledge queries. This work presents a significant step forward in leveraging LLMs for accurate and comprehensive biomedical question answering. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Tweets in Germany were examined in the first three months of COVID-19 and monkeypox to examine concerns and issues raised by the public. Understanding views and positions of the public could help to shape future public health campaigns. Few qualitative studies reviewed large datasets, and the results provide the first instance of the public thinking comparing COVID-19 and monkeypox. We retrieved 15,936 tweets from Germany using query words related to both epidemics in the first three months of each one. A sequential explanatory mixed methods research joined a machine learning approach with thematic analysis using a novel rapid tweet analysis protocol. In COVID-19 tweets, there was the selfing construct or feeling part of the emerging narrative of the spread and response. In contrast, during monkeypox, the public considered othering after the fatigue of the COVID-19 response, or an impersonal feeling toward the disease. During monkeypox, coherence and reconceptualization of new and competing information produced a customer rather than a consumer/producer model. Public healthcare policy should reconsider a one-size-fits-all model during information campaigns and produce a strategic approach embedded within a customer model to educate the public about preventative measures and updates. A multidisciplinary approach could prevent and minimize mis/disinformation. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The information systems (IS) discipline offers a unique perspective to move this stream of literature forward. Using a semiautomated thematic analysis approach based on the topic modeling technique, we review a broad range of information security literature to investigate how we may integrate and advance our understanding of information security. Our analysis reveals four major themes, including information security policy (ISP) compliance, motivations and susceptibility, software security decisions, and firm security strategy. We also identify a theme of security in broader contexts, in which studies consider the societal impacts of information security and online hacker behavior. This review contributes to IS literature by 1) synthesizing the broad range of information security research published in the top journals of the field, moving beyond prior reviews focusing on a narrower scope such as individual ISP compliance; 2) identifying major themes and proposing an overarching research framework encompassing these themes and their interconnections, allowing us to envision future research directions; and 3) enumerating a semiautomated topic modeling approach that other researchers can employ.  © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The originality of this study resides in the employment of deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to execute sentiment analysis with an elevated degree of complexity. The examination encompasses three principal dimensions of sentiment: Sentiment, Tone, and Object, with the intention of offering profound insights into public perceptions regarding various social challenges. The fundamental sentiment is categorized into three classifications: Positive, Neutral, and Negative. Moreover, the Tone analysis introduces an additional layer of comprehension that encompasses Support, Suggestion, Criticism, Complaint, and Others, thereby delineating a more precise communicative context. The Object dimension is employed to ascertain the target of the sentiment, whether it pertains to an Individual, Organization, Policy, or other entity. This inquiry applied the analysis to several clusters of social issues, including Poverty and Economic Disparity, Health and Wellbeing, Education and Literacy, Violence and Security, as well as Environment and Social Life. The findings are anticipated to aid the government in devising policies that are more effective and responsive to the exigencies of society, through an enhanced understanding of public sentiment. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

The use of dark patterns is considered an infringement of users' rights and privacy. In this study, we reveal the users' responses toward dark patterns by analyzing 12 years of tweets. Our findings include 1) users in countries in which dark patterns-related regulations have been implemented have a higher level of discussions about dark patterns; 2) tweets about dark patterns shifted from around 2017 from sharing their diversity to acting to resist them; 3) the commonly discussed dark pattern types of tweets are sneaking, obstruction, and interface interference, which are widely used in e-commerce sites. Our findings may help policymakers and regulators to promote our more secure internet use.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Analyzing German parliamentary debates on agriculture and food with structural topic modeling\n                    ABSTRACT: This study employs structural topic modeling (STM) to quantitatively and for the first time analyze parliamentary debates on agriculture and food in the German Bundestag, focusing on the period leading up to the 2023 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Drawing on data from parliamentary speeches between January 2017 and June 2022, the research aims to understand whether and, if so, how key challenges of the agri-food sector identified by scientists are addressed by the parliamentarians. The paper thus adds empirical evidence concerning the debate on the uptake of research knowledge in politics. It does so by identifying key topics, tracking their temporal evolution, and assessing how party affiliation, constituency, gender, and age of the speakers influence discourse. The results reveal 24 distinct topics, spanning areas such as agriculture-environment interactions, rural development, animal welfare, and economic aspects of farming. Temporal analysis shows shifting priorities over time, with economic issues and sector transformation gaining prominence as CAP negotiations progress. Critically, the findings suggest that parliamentary discourse in Germany aligns with main challenges the agri-food sector faces, albeit with variations influenced by party affiliation, geographical and demographic factors. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of parliamentary engagement with agricultural issues and informs policy-making and voter decision-making processes. Its breakdown of how (frequently) certain issues were discussed reveals general trends, but also country-specific challenges, allowing for better comparative policy analysis. © 2024 The Author\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We employed machine-learning-based natural language processing techniques to analyze the user-generated content posted on Twitter of Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) student-athletes to study changes in their sentiment as it relates to the COVID-19 crisis, major societal events, and policy decisions. Our analysis found that positive sentiment slightly outweighed negative sentiment overall, but that there was a noticeable uptick in negative sentiment in May and June 2020 in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter protests. The most commonly expressed emotions by these athletes were joy, trust, anticipation, and fear, suggesting that they used social media as an outlet to share primarily optimistic sentiments, while still publicly expressing strong negative sentiments like fear and trepidation about the pandemic and other important contemporary events. Athletic administrators, ACC coaches, support staff, and other professionals can use findings like these to guide sound, evidence-based decision-making and to better track and promote the emotional wellness of student-athletes.

This information is already abundant and available via Online Social Media. The missing link is a rigorous, anonymized and open source artefact that gives feedback to stakeholders and constituents. To address this, BeWell, an unobtrusive, low latency multi-resolution measurement for the observation, analysis and modelling of community dynamics, is proposed. To assess communal well-being, 42 Facebook pages of a large public university in Germany are analyzed with a dictionary-based text analytics program, LIWC. We establish the baseline of emotive discourse across the sample, and detect significant campus-wide events in this proof of concept implementation, then discuss future iterations including a community dashboard and a participatory management plan.

We purport that members of parliament (MPs) balance a variety of incentives over the electoral cycle. While they emphasize issues that relate to the policy-making agenda of their party right after an election, competition with other parties increasingly gains influence over legislators’ priorities as the next election day approaches. We show supportive evidence for these patterns based on a unique longitudinal dataset combining information on sponsorship of legislative proposals, public opinion, party manifestos, and committee chair positions in Germany between 1990 and 2013. By bringing variation within the electoral cycle to our attention, the results enhance our understanding of the factors that set the incentive structure for MPs and the relationship between party competition and legislative behavior. © 2023 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Such a task can be accomplished by directly querying the policy statement with the regulation text. Automation of the process requires an expressive meaning-based framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper discusses the Ontological Semantics approach to the issue of verifying compliance and illustrates the potential of utilizing the framework in the domain of Privacy management for NLP-related tasks. As an example a section from BCBS and corresponding HIPAA regulations are used. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In March 2020, 476.696 tweets about the government policy in COVID-19 spread on Twitter were captured by the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef). Government policy has a standard meaning, namely a decision systematically made by the government with specific goals and objectives relating to the public interest, whether carried out directly or indirectly. Sentiment analysis analyzes people’s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from written language. In this decade, Sentiment Analysis is has become a trendy research area. The purpose of this paper is to focus how to implement word2vec using similarity word as a feature expansion for minimize the vocabulary mismatch in Twitter Sentiment Analysis using “word embeddings”. This research contains 11.395 tweets for a dataset, where the dataset will be used in two classifications: Support Vector Machine Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network Algorithm. The output of Word2Vec will be used for feature expansion in this research, where the algorithm of expansion will check in each row in the corpus where has a similarity vector with that word and will replace the word with the similarity of this words if the value is 0. The dataset in Feature Expansion is using 142.545 articles from Indonesian media. The result of this research is ANN is better than SVM, where the ANN without feature expansion gets 68.89 % and using feature expansion gets 72.58 %. For SVM, the final accuracy without feature expansion is 63.95 %, and using feature expansion gets 68.56 %. This research proves that feature expansion can improve the final accuracy. © 2021, Ikatan Ahli Informatika Indonesia.

Textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) are glass boxes introduced for extracting and understanding mindsets' structure (in Latin forma mentis) from textual data. Combining network science, psycholinguistics and Big Data, TFMNs successfully identified relevant concepts in benchmark texts, without supervision. Once validated, TFMNs were applied to the case study of distorted mindsets about the gender gap in science. Focusing on social media, this work analysed 10,000 tweets mostly representing individuals' opinions at the beginning of posts. ``Gender'' and ``gap'' elicited a mostly positive, trustful and joyous perception, with semantic associates that: celebrated successful female scientists, related gender gap to wage differences, and hoped for a future resolution. The perception of ``woman'' highlighted jargon of sexual harassment and stereotype threat (a form of implicit cognitive bias) about women in science ``sacrificing personal skills for success''. The semantic frame of ``man'' highlighted awareness of the myth of male superiority in science. No anger was detected around ``person'', suggesting that tweets got less tense around genderless terms. No stereotypical perception of ``scientist'' was identified online, differently from real-world surveys. This analysis thus identified that Twitter discourse mostly starting conversations promoted a majorly stereotype-free, positive/trustful perception of gender disparity, aimed at closing the gap. Hence, future monitoring against discriminating language should focus on other parts of conversations like users' replies. TFMNs enable new ways for monitoring collective online mindsets, offering data-informed ground for policy making. © 2020 PeerJ Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research examines Fb data from 2016 to 2024 to investigate the role of online engagement in drought management. This study evaluates public discourse on drought-related matters through the analysis of five fundamental terms. The research employs topic modeling and sentiment analysis to assess regional awareness and utilizes machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Naive Bayes) in conjunction with Bag of Words to forecast drought progression. The research highlights the potential of Fb data in facilitating real-time drought management, offering significant hydrological insights. The study elucidates regional disparities in drought awareness through the examination of key terminology and sentiment, revealing that some regions exhibit a more rapid reaction to water scarcity, as indicated by Fb engagement. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Naive Bayes facilitates a predictive paradigm for detecting prospective drought hotspots through online discourse analysis. The study confirmed that participation in online communities successfully (p ≤ 0.04) alleviates the impact of drought and, on Facebook, significantly enhanced drought awareness across various regions of Pakistan (p ≤ 0.5), as confirmed through statistical analysis with a paired t-test and regression analysis over labeled sentiment and topic-classified data. Fb engagement may function as a proactive indicator, assisting policymakers and hydrologists in optimizing water resource allocation in drought-prone areas, thus enhancing drought mitigation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This is the first study to investigate the non prescribed GAH use behavior among transgender men in mainland China in response to the public health threat. We collected data through interviewing Chinese transgender men and mining information from their commonly-used social medial platforms with Natural Language Process (NLP) of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The motivation, means to obtain, and outcomes of their nonprescription GAH use were examined. We found that transgender men in mainland China resort to the non prescribed GAH use because they have been denied the access to prescribed GAH due to barriers produced by ant-trans stigma as the structural determinant. A conceptual framework was developed to illustrate how transgender stigma has discriminated Chinese transgender men at health policy and institutional levels and shaped Chinese transmen's nonprescription GAH use behavior. The parent-child relationship, laden with the Confucian value of filial piety, was highlighted as the cultural gatekeeper for transgender stigma to reinforce cisnormativity and prevent Chinese transgender men from obtaining prescribed GAH they need. This framework also sheds light into how these transgender men have strived to communicate with their self-created coded language to counter stigmatizing discourse on their sexual and gender identities to make life livable in a transphobic society. Our work would lay a foundation for understanding how transgender stigma is locally produced in mainland China and contributes to the denial of Chinese transgender men's access to fundamental health services as human beings, and advocate for effective intervention. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Evidence from an activity theory perspective\n                    ABSTRACT: Despite the proliferation of help options for computer-based second language (L2) listening comprehension, little attention has been given to a comprehensive understanding of the pedagogical effects. To gain a thorough understanding of the overall and moderator effects, drawing on the activity theory (AT), this study conducted a meta-analysis of 33 valid independent studies on help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension with 3697 participants involved. Results demonstrated that (a) compared with those traditional methods, help options are found to be more facilitative for L2 listening comprehension with a small-to-moderate effect of g = 0.449, 95% CI [0.303, 0.596]; and (b) the effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension are moderated by option types, feedback types, language distance types, intervention durations and learning activity types. Motivated by the results obtained, this study also discussed pedagogical implications for future studies. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The improved pedagogical effects of help options for computer-based second language (L2) listening comprehension have been well-documented. A large number of studies on the use of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension have been published. There has been no research aggregating the overall effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension. Some potential factors that may moderate the effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension remain underexplored. What this paper adds This paper aims to aggregate the overall and moderator effects from the existing publications of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension. Compared with those traditional methods, help options are found to be more facilitative for L2 listening comprehension with a small-to-moderate effect of g = 0.449. The effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening are moderated by option types, feedback types, language distance types, intervention durations and learning activity types. Implications for practice and/or policy Help options have been confirmed to facilitate computer-based L2 listening comprehension, especially among learners of primary and secondary levels. Call for more empirical studies investigating how different types of options, feedback, language distance and intervention durations along with learning activity moderate the effectiveness. Further attempts should investigate help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension with the integration of generative AI, large language model (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. © 2024 British Educational Research Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Consequently, users tend not to read the privacy policies, thus putting their privacy at risk. This paper describes an automated approach for assisting users to evaluate online privacy policies based on completeness. The term completeness refers to the presence of 8 sections in an online privacy policy that have been recognized as helpful in establishing the transparency of a privacy policy. Given a new online privacy policy, the proposed system employs a machine-learning based approach to predict a completeness score for the privacy policy. This score can then be used by the user to assess the risk to their privacy. © 2015 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this study, we systematically review the literature about this relationship. We obtained a sample of 204 articles published in the period from February 2020 to March 2022. Using topic modelling and qualitative analysis, we identify seven main topics on the nexus of COVID-19 and climate change: (1) impacts of COVID-19 on climate change and policy; (2) sustainable recovery after COVID-19; (3) public concern about climate change and COVID-19; (4) lessons from COVID-19 for climate change action; (5) effects of COVID-19 and climate change on the economy, food security and poverty; (6) collective responses to crises and (7) similarities and differences between COVID-19 and climate change. We discuss lessons derived from each of these topics and identify key policies and strategies for a sustainable recovery from COVID-19. Investments in low-carbon technologies and carbon taxation are the most commonly suggested policy solutions. If climate targets are to be met, climate action needs to be the focus of COVID-19 recovery.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the factors responsible for student’s behavioural intentions to use these tools are still not fully understood, especially in the context of Nigerian higher education institutions (HEIs). To support students use of Content Generative - Artificial Intelligence (CG-AI) tools for learning and research purposes, it is important that HEI administrators and policy makers understand these factors. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence Nigerian students’ behavioural intentions to use CG-AI tools for learning and research. Based on structural equation modelling technique, this study uses the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to examine the relationship between six constructs and students’ behavioural intentions to use CG-AI. Employing a paper-based survey, responses from 289 students in the Department of Computer Science were obtained from a State University in northern Nigeria. A two-step approach (Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Path Analysis) was used to analyse the relationships between both observed and latent variables. The findings showed that three of the factors, performance expectancy (α = 0.551, p < 0.001), effort expectancy (α = 0.466, p < 0.001), and social influence (α = 0.507, p < 0.001) were observed to be determinants of behavioural intentions to use CG-AI tools. Facilitating conditions, perceived risks, and attitude towards technology, on the other hand, showed no significant impact on students’ behavioural intention to use CG-AI tools. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, from the literature review, it was found that there is a scarcity of studies done on understanding the factors that affect the mode choices of women with disability. This study fills in that gap and aims to understand the experiences and challenges that affect the mode choice of women with disabilities while carrying out trips for various purposes and how they differ from their male counterparts. Through a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) methodology, questions were asked to women with disability to understand their experience and expectations from the transportation system in Bangalore, India. Sentiment analysis was carried out to understand the emotions and sentiments of two women groups while commuting in Bangalore. Working women with walking disabilities expressed that poor road infrastructure, unsafe travel experiences, lack of disabled-friendly public transport, and lack of disabled-friendly parking facilities are hurdles in commuting while women with visual impairments expressed challenges in navigation and challenges in using public transport as major barriers in travelling. The key finding of the study was that due to these challenges, women with disabilities are forced to curtail their commute or shift to non-sustainable modes of transportation, which have major implications on their education, economic condition as well as social well-being, affecting their overall Quality of Life. The study concludes with policy recommendations that can encourage and empower this section of women and provide easy access to transportation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It has been studied that digitisation, digitalisation and digital transformation (DDT) can improve efficiency, profitability and growth among SMEs. This paper studies the extent of adoption of DDT by a sample of listed SMEs in India and examines its impact on their growth. Unlike traditional methods of interviewing SMEs, this study uses a text-mining method to estimate the extent of DDT. The key words have been drawn from the literature, and the proposed methodology can help in understanding the relative positioning of the SME units in IT adoption and areas for policy intervention. We define an index of digitisation which helps us in identifying companies that are still under digitised. Further, as the period of our study is that of the COVID pandemic, the effect of digitisation has not yet been reflected in their sales growth.

The explorative study reveals the most significant factors that could predict museum visitors’ behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on the theory of planned behavior and the “cognitive-affective-conative” model to analyze TripAdvisor reviews (n = 23020) and understand the relationship between the affective and the conative components of consumer behavior. Quantitative text-mining analysis allowed us to view every lemma of every review as a single factor for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Findings: The research has enlarged the literature on museum consumer behavior. Behavioral intentions of museum visitors are affected by satisfaction dimensions, especially emotions felt; the esthetic dimension and museums’ surroundings affect consumers’ overall willingness to share positive emotions, while bad service quality and pricing policy make a visit to the museums less satisfying. Practical implications: Managers can enhance their offerings and attract new consumers by identifying the satisfaction dimensions that influence their intentions to share positive emotions. The research findings can aid museums, tour agencies and government officials in developing targeted products and strategies to meet consumers’ expectations and promote urban tourism. Originality/value: The research identified the dimensions that influence visitors’ willingness to share positive emotions through user-generated content in the context of museums. The study applies quantitative text analysis based on logit regression, which is a novel approach in the field of urban tourism research. © 2023, © International Tourism Studies Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Living Environment and Trend of Wood Utilization\n                    ABSTRACT: Improving public awareness of wood is crucial for expanding the use of wood and establishing a wood culture. In this study, the environment and trends of the public’s wood utilization were analyzed using a questionnaire survey and online text mining at a time when eco-friendly practices are gaining popularity. As a result of reducing climatic and environmental concerns and its positive physical and psychological effects, the use of wood is predicted to rise in areas intimately connected to everyday living, such as wood furniture, wooden structures, and interior materials. Nonetheless, there was a negative awareness that wood was expensive, difficult to maintain, and associated with deforestation. The correlations between wood-related search terms on major Korean portal sites were analyzed and categorized into five groups: Wooden architecture, cultural education, woodworking, wood industry, and wood policy. As a building material, wood was seen as more traditional and friendly than reinforced concrete and stone. Eighty-six percent of respondents expected to utilize wood as a building material in the future, regardless of whether the wood is domestically produced or imported. Sixty-five percent responded favorably about the effects of wood on the health of wooden home inhabitants. It is believed that both active publicity and quantifiable value analysis of human and environmental friendliness are required to increase pro-environment awareness of wood utilization. © 2022 The Korean Society of Wood Science & Technology.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this sense, greenwashingis used when a company states a false claim about its products and practices being environmentally friendly. It is an important issue and has attracted the attention of policymakers to strengthen consumer law and new companies with the mission of helping brands and consumers to become more eco-friendly. However, manual screening of websites and social networks for sustainable claims (green claims) is time-consuming. Automatic detection of green claims is an underexplored problem from a computer science perspective, and thus, we present the design, training and evaluation of different approaches in this study. Our experiments reveal that although pre-trained models present high performance, they also show sensibility to adversarial attacks, such as character-swap-based methods, which are common in social networks. In order to understand the applicability in a real-world scenario, we also evaluated its generalization performance, which showed a notable performance across different domains.  © 2021 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

But large bodies of legal documents present challenges for conventional topic modeling methods. The task of gathering, reviewing, coding, sorting, and assessing a body of tens of thousands of legal documents is a daunting proposition. Yet recent advances in computational text analytics, a subset of the field of “artificial intelligence,” are already gaining traction in legal practice settings such as e-discovery by leveraging the speed and capacity of computers to process enormous bodies of documents, and there is good reason to believe legal researchers can take advantage of these new methods as well. Differences between conventional and computational methods, however, suggest that computational text modeling has its own limitations. The two methods used in unison, therefore, could be a powerful research tool for legal scholars. To explore and critically evaluate that potential, we assembled a large corpus of presidential documents to assess how computational topic modeling compares to conventional methods and evaluate how legal scholars can best make use of the computational methods. We focused on presidential “direct actions,” such as executive orders, presidential memoranda, proclamations, and other exercises of authority the President can take alone, without congressional concurrence or agency involvement. Presidents have been issuing direct actions throughout the history of the republic, and although the actions have often been the target of criticism and controversy in the past, lately they have become a tinderbox of debate. Hence, although long ignored by political scientists and legal scholars, there has been a surge of interest in the scope, content, and impact of presidential direct actions. Legal and policy scholars modeling direct actions into substantive topic classifications thus far have not employed computational methods. To compare the results of their conventional modeling methods with the computational method, we generated computational topic models of all direct actions over time periods other scholars have studied using conventional methods, and did the same for a case study of environmental-policy direct actions. Our computational model of all direct actions closely matched one of the two comprehensive empirical models developed using conventional methods. By contrast, our environmental-case-study model differed markedly from the only empirical topic model of environmental-policy direct actions using conventional methods, revealing that the conventional methods model included trivial categories and omitted important alternative topics. Provided a sufficiently large corpus of documents is used, our findings support the assessment that computational topic modeling can reveal important insights for legal scholars in designing and validating their topic models of legal text. To be sure, computational topic modeling used alone has its limitations, some of which are evident in our models, but when used along with conventional methods, it opens doors towards reaching more confident conclusions about how to conceptualize topics in law. Drawing from these results, we offer several use cases for computational topic modeling in legal research. At the front end, researchers can use the method to generate better and more complete topic-model hypotheses. At the back end, the method can effectively be used, as we did, to validate existing topic models. And at a meta-scale, the method opens windows to test and challenge conventional legal theory. Legal scholars can do all of these without “the machines,” but there is good reason to believe we can do it better with them in the toolkit. © 2018 George Washington University.

Notably, recent advancements in multi-round on-policy self-improving methods allow LLMs to generate new examples for training subsequent models. At the same time, multi-agent LLM systems, involving automated interactions among agents, are also increasing in prominence. Thus, in both short and long terms, LLMs may actively engage in an evolutionary process. We draw parallels between the behavior of LLMs and the evolution of human culture, as the latter has been extensively studied by cognitive scientists for decades. Our approach involves leveraging Iterated Learning (IL), a Bayesian framework that elucidates how subtle biases are magnified during human cultural evolution, to explain some behaviors of LLMs. This paper outlines key characteristics of agents' behavior in the Bayesian-IL framework, including predictions that are supported by experimental verification with various LLMs. This theoretical framework could help to more effectively predict and guide the evolution of LLMs in desired directions.

Maybe More So Than You Think\n                    ABSTRACT: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO’s vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the vulnerabilities of DPO by simpler methods so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5% of the data. We further the investigate efficacy of the existing defence methods and find that these poisoning attacks can evade the existing data anomaly detection methods.

This study uses the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMA) frame analysis grounded approach and examines the 2017 Sutherland Springs, Texas, mass shooting coverage in a house of worship by three U.S. cable television networks—CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. News reports for the first seven days following the shooting were collected from the cable networks' Twitter, YouTube, and website accounts. A total of 290 news reports were analyzed and 760 aggregate units for frames were coded. The results demonstrate that ANTMA grounded approach is an effective method for frame analysis and support research about the news media's emphasis on victims, community, and individual frames in cases of mass shootings. They identify differences in the issue-based frame of gun vs. mental health debates. Additional new frames of empathy, interventions, reactions, and security were discovered. Results also show differences in frames used and their frequency between the digital platforms of Twitter, YouTube, and websites and cable organizations. These differences show each media network's ideological perspectives or competing news narratives. The findings raise relevant questions to news coverage, policy debates about mental health and gun violence, and cultural awareness of the problem of mass shootings and public safety as the world becomes more global.

From a public policy perspective, identifying stakeholders, issues and trends is a daunting challenge, only partially addressed by traditional observation systems. Nowadays, social media is one of the biggest channels of public expression and is often used to communicate opinions and content related to City Logistics. The idea of this research is that analyzing social media content could help in understanding the public perception of City Logistics. This paper offers a methodology for collecting content from Twitter and implementing machine learning techniques (Unsupervised Learning and Natural Language Processing), to perform content and sentiment analysis. The proposed methodology is applied to more than 110 000 tweets containing City Logistics key-terms. Results allowed the building of an Interest Map of concepts and a Sentiment Analysis to determine if City Logistics entries are positive, negative or neutral. © 2020 The Authors.

It has been applied in games, recommendation systems and natural language processing. However, it is still a challenge to ensure the safety of reinforcement learning algorithms when applied to robotics in the real world. In recent years, the safe reinforcement learning methods for robotics systems have become a hot research direction, gaining extensive attention in robotics and reinforcement learning communities. This paper surveys important achievements and development tendency of safe reinforcement learning based on the existing work and focuses on their applicability in robotics. This paper first introduces the general problem description of safe reinforcement learning. Then we focus on the latest significant progress in this field from the perspective of method and performance, including constraint policy optimization, control barrier function, safety filter and adversarial training methods, and their applications in autonomous driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and other robotic systems.

This paper focuses on the context of a car-dependent island in the Mediterranean – Malta, where the introduction of active travel interventions is an essential but persistently difficult undertaking. The study aims to test a fully virtual method to better understand the perceptions of the islands' population of such interventions. The study deploys a Virtual Urban Living Lab (VULL), a purposely designed online participatory platform with interactive activities in which participants can give feedback on proposed intervention ideas and propose their own. The feedback was collected from 113 users over the span of a week in December 2023. Using sentiment analysis conducted through a large language model (ChatGPT 4), the findings from the VULL shed light on how the Maltese population perceives stakeholder-proposed ideas to re-design urban streets. A discussion on the main challenges and points of contention, and the positive features of the proposed intervention follows. The paper concludes with an overview of the policy-relevant feedback and the potential for urban planners and policymakers to use VULL and language models as tools for understanding public sentiment. © 2025 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The research is mainly based on the method of comparing text documents in natural language processing. The primary parameter for the analysis of the text corpus is the wording of the Strategy. The news features on the websites are checked for their consistency with the trends of the state nationality policy indicated in the document as the most voluminous section of the Strategy. The array of textual data is represented by 397 news items published on the websites in 2019. The comparison of textual data shows that the largest number of matches is found on the news feed of the website of the Council for Interethnic Relations. The focus area with the greater number of matches across all websites is establishing the environment to preserve and enrich the Russian language and the languages of the peoples of the Russian Federation. © 2020 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study collects the livestock manure treatment policy texts and livestock feeding data of 70 local governments, and uses data mining and related analysis methods to analyze the relationships between actions, actors and the effect of livestock breeding pollution control in local government policies. The results show that: The better the transmission of actions and the greater the number of actors involved in transmission of actions, the better effect of livestock breeding pollution control. It is necessary to strengthen collaboration with Department of Natural Resources in building a cycle of planting and breeding development mechanism as well as acceleration of the transformation and upgrading of animal husbandry. Meanwhile, the collaboration with Department of Science and Technology should be enhanced in strengthening fiscal and taxation policy support, and coordinating the solution of land and electricity use problems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

There is a growing number of university students using AI like ChatGPT and Bard to support their academic experience. Much of the AI in higher education research to date has focused on academic integrity and matters of authorship; yet, there may be unintended consequences beyond these concerns for students. That is, there may be people who reduce their formal social interactions while using these tools. This study evaluates 387 university students and their relationship to–and with–artificial intelligence large-language model-based tools. Using structural equation modelling, the study finds evidence that while AI chatbots designed for information provision may be associated with student performance, when social support, psychological wellbeing, loneliness, and sense of belonging are considered it has a net negative effect on achievement. This study tests an AI-specific form of social support, and the cost it may pose to student success, wellbeing, and retention. Indeed, while AI chatbot usage may be associated with poorer social outcomes, human-substitution activity that may be occurring when a student chooses to seek support from an AI rather than a human (e.g. a librarian, professor, or student advisor) may pose interesting learning and teaching policy implications. We explore the implications of this from the lens of student success and belonging. © 2024 The Author(s).

While popular narrative extraction methods such as Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts. We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in content or a narrative shift took place. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An effective recognition method significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) technology have spurred the development of statement recognition techniques. However, many methods rely on extensive datasets, and numerous sectors struggle to keep pace with intelligent advancements due to data scarcity. Policy-related questions, which often involve a plethora of technical terms, exemplify this challenge. For colloquial questions with intricate structures, models require enhanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models must prioritize key information and filter out irrelevant data, particularly when data availability is limited. To address these issues, this study utilized medical insurance approval items and related questions as data sources. It employed sentence vectors and question structures as analytical frameworks and explored innovative solutions. Specifically, the twin network fine-tuning pretraining model RoBERTa was applied to classify medical insurance items, integrating syntactic structure and question word features to pinpoint question targets. This method outperformed standard text classification models in the medical insurance domain and has potential applicability in other policy-oriented Q&A systems, thereby offering precise services to the public. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the entire pocess of building ontologies from texts cannot be fully automated and it is important to guide the knowledge engineer during the building process. This paper presents an enriched version of TERMINAE, which is a text-based methodology for ontology design. It combines a fact-based approach of modeling with the more traditional concept-centric one. We show that named entities can be used to enrich an existing ontology and to bootstrap the acquisition process. In other words, named entities are used for the conceptualisation of ontologies and not only for their population. This approach is illustrated on two use-cases based on policy documents and evaluated by measuring the Precision and Recall of the resulting ontologies with respect to pre-existing ontologies independently built by domain experts.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A bibliometric analysis of policies in China\n                    ABSTRACT: Answering how and why policies emerge and interact with one another will advance our understanding of the evolution of policies. The paper investigates policy emergence as a practice defining possible policy objects in a specific domain and policy interaction as a practice enabling the defined objects. To trace the policy evolution, we define three types of citations to describe policymaking processes, establish the citation and co-citation networks of policy documents, and then conduct a natural language processing-based bibliometric analysis. We reveal the patterns of policymaking practices and identify the focal policies in a given domain. The results within the context of Chinese innovation and entrepreneurial policies suggest the information contained in focal policies drives the direction of future policy themes, as well as regular policies, tend to cite focal policies and follow the ideas of focal policies to achieve their goals. Our findings also provide some implications for Chinese future policymaking.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to enhance understanding of loneliness dynamics through building towards a global loneliness map using social intelligence analysis. Settings and design This paper presents a proof of concept for the global loneliness map, using data collected in October 2022. Twitter posts containing keywords such as € lonely', € loneliness', € alone', € solitude' and € isolation' were gathered, resulting in 841 796 tweets from the USA. City-specific data were extracted from these tweets to construct a loneliness map for the country. Sentiment analysis using the valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning tool was employed to differentiate metaphorical expressions from meaningful correlations between loneliness and socioeconomic and emotional factors. Measures and results The sentiment analysis encompassed the USA dataset and city-wise subsets, identifying negative sentiment tweets. Psychosocial linguistic features of these negative tweets were analysed to reveal significant connections between loneliness, socioeconomic aspects and emotional themes. Word clouds depicted topic variations between positively and negatively toned tweets. A frequency list of correlated topics within broader socioeconomic and emotional categories was generated from negative sentiment tweets. Additionally, a comprehensive table displayed top correlated topics for each city. Conclusions Leveraging social media data provide insights into the multifaceted nature of loneliness. Given its subjectivity, loneliness experiences exhibit variability. This study serves as a proof of concept for an extensive global loneliness map, holding implications for global public health strategies and policy development. Understanding loneliness dynamics on a larger scale can facilitate targeted interventions and support. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

In this paper we concentrate on acquiring NLP data by means of games. Two different projects are presented and various aspects of these games are discussed. First, we discuss public-made collections of linguistic data generally: the quality and reliability of contributors and collections, and the high dependence of number of contributions on motivation and contribution policy. Second, we describe creation of games for acquiring NLP data in detail. As example, two existing games are presented. Finally, evaluation techniques for both projects are discussed. © Tribun EU 2010.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The research employs a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to identify and mine themes from comment texts, extracting multiple core discussion topics. The results show that although negative sentiments slightly outweighed positive sentiments in public comments, there was no significant difference in the focal points of attention between positive and negative sentiments. Negative sentiments primarily centered on policy specifics and implementation methods, with key concerns including details of policy execution and operational challenges. Cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, and Hangzhou exhibited higher volumes of policy-related discussions, indicating greater public engagement in these regions. Analysis of IP address distribution revealed pronounced regional concentration, particularly among residents in developed eastern coastal areas. Finally, the study proposes strategic recommendations for optimizing information dissemination on social media to enhance public willingness to participate in waste sorting initiatives.

Here, we test the hypothesis that biodiversity science has become more interdisciplinary over time. To do so, we analyze 97,945 peer-reviewed articles over a twenty-two-year time period (1990–2012) with a continuous time dynamic model, which classifies articles into concepts (i.e., topics and ideas) based on word co-occurrences. Using the model output, we then quantify different aspects of interdisciplinarity: concept diversity, that is, the diversity of topics and ideas across subdisciplines in biodiversity science, subdiscipline diversity, that is, the diversity of subdisciplines across concepts, and network structure, which captures interactions between concepts and subdisciplines. We found that, on average, concept and subdiscipline diversity in biodiversity science were either stable or declining, patterns which were driven by the persistence of rare concepts and subdisciplines and a decline in the diversity of common concepts and subdisciplines, respectively. Moreover, our results provide evidence that conceptual homogenization, that is, decreases in temporal β concept diversity, underlies the observed trends in interdisciplinarity. Together, our results reveal that biodiversity science is undergoing a dynamic phase as a scientific discipline that is consolidating around a core set of concepts. Our results suggest that progress toward addressing the biodiversity crisis via greater interdisciplinarity during the study period may have been slowed by extrinsic factors, such as the failure to invest in research spanning across concepts and disciplines. However, recent initiatives such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) may attract broader support for biodiversity-related issues and hence interdisciplinary approaches to address scientific, political, and societal challenges in the coming years. © 2019 The Authors.

The discussion on anthropogenic climate change in general, and social media specifically, has multiple different narratives. Understanding the discourses can assist efforts of mitigation, adaptation, and policy measures development. In this work, we collected 333,635 tweets in English about anthropogenic climate change. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning methods to embed the semantic meaning of the tweets into vectors, cluster the tweets, and analyze the results. We clustered the tweets into four clusters that correspond to four narratives in the discussion. Analyzing the behavioral dynamics of each cluster revealed that the clusters focus on the discussion of whether climate change is caused by humans or not, scientific arguments, policy, and conspiracy. The research results can serve as input for media policy and awareness-raising measures on climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, and facilitating future communications related to climate change. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A preceding study’s results found that there is public concern with regard to the safety of high-tech foods, such as genetically modified foods and genome-edited foods. Twitter, one of the most popular social networks, allows users to post their opinions instantaneously, making it an extremely useful tool to collect what people are actually saying online in a timely manner. Therefore, it was used for collecting data on the users’ concerns with and expectations of high-tech foods. This study collected and analyzed Twitter data on genome-edited foods and their labeling from May 25 to October 15 in 2019. Of 14,066 unique user IDs, 94.9% posted 5 or less tweets, whereas 64.8% tweeted only once, indicating that the majority of users who tweeted on this issue are not as intense, as they posted tweets consistently. After a process of refining, there were 28,722 tweets, of which 2,536 tweets (8.8%) were original, 326 (1.1%) were replies, and 25,860 (90%) were retweets. The numbers of tweets increased in response to government announcements and news content in the media. A total of six prominent peaks were detected during the investigation period, proving that Twitter could serve as a tool for monitoring degree of users’ interests in real time. The co-occurrence network of original and reply tweets provided different words from various tweets that appeared with a certain frequency. However, the network derived from all tweets seemed to concentrate on words from specific tweets with negative overtones. As a result of sentiment analysis, 54.5% to 62.8% tweets were negative about genome-edited food and the labeling policy of the Consumer Affairs Agency, respectively, indicating a strong demand for mandatory labeling. These findings are expected to contribute to the communication strategy of genome-edited foods toward social implementation by government officers and science communicators. © Copyright © 2020 Tabei, Shimura, Kwon, Itaka and Fukino.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Attackers create more complicated attack patterns and configure attack behavior to resemble normal behavior to evade detection by defenders. Thus, it is indispensable to configure a security system that accurately detects attacks on each user's system. Since the attack does not occur only at a specific point in the network, there is a limitation in identifying computer intrusion simply using network packets. A Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) is a highly effective tool for monitoring computer systems and detecting unusual or unauthorized activities. HIDS can quickly identify potential security threats by closely monitoring and analyzing system logs, configurations, file integrity, and events specific to a host machine. It helps maintain the security and integrity of individual systems by detecting unauthorized activities or policy violations. With its advanced capabilities and reliable performance, HIDS is essential to any comprehensive host-based security strategy. Although HIDS can detect insider intrusions, the known HIDS detection methods are limited to specific attacks and may be ineffective against new attack patterns. Recently, researchers applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) in HIDS to scrutinize complex attack patterns, but they could have more effectively provided useful outputs for detecting intrusions based on these patterns. In this paper, we use reinforcement learning methodology, Actor-Critic, and NLP to extract keywords that occur on each anomaly system call log and propose a rule generation framework to prevent future intrusion detection using the extracted words. We analyze the anomaly log using NLP and extract the characteristics of each attack log as the 'keyword.' Based on the unique keywords of each attack log, we utilize reinforcement learning to establish a set of rules to protect against attacks. We extracted keywords based on textrank from the system call log sequence and simultaneously provided ground truth data using the extracted keywords. Based on the extracted keywords, the pre-trained Seq2Seq model generate rules according to the reward calculation method in reinforcement learning. When calculating the reward in reinforcement learning, we used the comparison value with the pre-trained Seq2Seq model, the malware log sequence detected by the rule set based on reinforcement learning, and the false positive value generated by the normal data to create its own rule set. We verified the proposed framework using the system call log datasets: ADFA-LD, LID-DS 2021 dataset. The proposed framework demonstrated a high accuracy rate of 96.5% average when faced with different attacks. We compared the accuracy based on the proposed framework detection, textrank, and Seq2Seq model-based keyword extraction methods.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with an international sample of educational professionals including researchers, teachers and designers, and reviewed interdisciplinary literature on personalisation to propose a framework for personalisation research and design. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed that professionals value each type of personalisation opportunity (eg, customising for age-appropriate content, supports for student choice, automated guidance based on learner responses) and identify challenges (eg, trade-offs between adaptive and standardised instruction). Three research/design dilemmas emerged: individualisation and equity; group customisation and individual benefit; and adaptation and validity of measurement. We discuss these dilemmas in relation to three categories of personalisation: customisation by designers or teachers to support a specific audience (grade level, course, community); individualisation to support user choice (of book to read, project topic); and adaptation of instructional activities based on automated analysis of logged user performance (performance metrics, natural language processing, cumulative indicators). We suggest some guiding questions for a generative agenda for future research on personalised instruction. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Personalised learning is popular among educational professionals. Personalised design has multiple and inconsistent definitions. A shared framework for personalised instruction would facilitate research and design. What this paper adds A succinct but comprehensive definition of personalised education. Perspectives on personalisation from an international group of practitioners and designers. A framework including three dilemmas to guide future research on the design and practice of personalised instruction. Implications for practice and/or policy A shared definition of personalisation can support communication across diverse stakeholders. The framework can guide future design and instruction with personalised educational technology. The framework identifies dilemmas that illustrate ethical pathways for policy-makers responsible for personalised education. © 2021 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 464,590 posts from January 2018 to April 2021 on the 82cook website were collected. The data were analyzed by text mining techniques, including term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), and network analyses, to identify the most prominent con-cerns faced by young people in South Korea. Findings: The study results showed that the most frequently discussed issues among mothers of adolescent children were 'educational environment,' 'physical health,' 'mental health,' 'studying abroad,' and 'child abuse.' As parents and children spend more time together during and early post-COVID-19 periods, 'child abuse' has emerged as a major issue. The distribution results by topic in the prior-and post-COVID-19 periods showed that education (44% and 41%, respectively) and health and well-being (25% and 28%, respectively) ranked the two most-frequently discussed issues among mothers. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is that the subjectivity of the researcher may have biased the setting of the topic names about the youth, and the classification results themselves cannot be considered perfect, as the algorithm automatically classified them. Originality/value: This paper provides academic originality and value by leveraging text mining to analyze the issues related to young people, thereby offering implications for policymakers, surpassing the informational value of traditional methods such as surveys or expert panels. © The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The advantages of using unsupervised learning for this task are numerous. The primary advantages include the ability to analyze any new corpus with a fraction of the effort required by supervised learning, the ability to study changes in topics of interest along time, and the ability to identify finer-grained topics of interest in these privacy policies. Based on general principles of document analysis we synthesize a cohesive framework for privacy policy topic modeling and apply it over a corpus of 4,982 privacy policies of mobile applications crawled from the Google Play Store. The results demonstrate that even with this relatively moderate-size corpus quite comprehensive insights can be attained regarding the focus and scope of current privacy policy documents. The topics extracted, their structure and the applicability of the unsupervised approach for that matter are validated through an extensive comparison to similar findings reported in prior work that uses supervised learning (which heavily depends on manual annotation of experts). The comparison suggests a substantial overlap between the topics found and those reported in prior work, and also unveils some new topics of interest. � 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, political campaigns strategically designed candidacy announcements on Twitter to produce a significant increase in online social media attention. We use large-scale online social media communications to study the factors of party, personality, and policy in the Twitter discourse following six major presidential campaign announcements for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We observe that all campaign announcements result in an instant bump in attention, with up to several orders of magnitude increase in tweets. However, we find that Twitter discourse as a result of this bump in attention has overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The bruising criticism, driven by crosstalk from Twitter users of opposite party affiliations, is organized by hashtags such as #NoMoreBushes and #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. We analyze how people take to Twitter to criticize specific personality traits and policy positions of presidential candidates. © 2017 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Understanding attitudes towards ChatGPT could help manage expectations and concerns for ChatGPT in academia, predict behaviour and inform policy. This study aimed to develop an understanding of university academics’ attitudes towards ChatGPT. A total of 11 university academics participated in semi-structured interviews. Data analysis found three main themes: (a) ethics, (b) changes to academic processes and (c) accessibility and inclusivity. Results showed academics had positive attitudes towards ChatGPT overall; however, they held negative attitudes towards the unethical use of the technology. Key findings included discrepancies in perceptions of academics’ personal ethical use of ChatGPT compared to unethical use by others. Furthermore, academics viewed ChatGPT as a useful tool for saving time and enhancing research processes and student learning. Finally, ChatGPT could increase equity among diverse groups, though it should be used with caution. Future studies could conduct a longitudinal study and recruit a larger and wider sample exploring specific and/or multidisciplinary domains for research diversity and the generalisability of findings. Implications for practice or policy: • Academic policy and codes of conduct concerning the use of ChatGPT in research and education can be refined to address key ethical concerns, such as plagiarism. • Academic educators and researchers can save time and improve processes using ChatGPT to attain better work-life balance and thus potentially improve the quality of their work.

However, gaps exist in reporting information such as victim injuries, mental health status and abuse types. The police record details of domestic violence events as structured information (e.g., gender, postcode, ethnicity), but also in text narratives describing other details such as injuries, substance use, and mental health status. However, the voluminous nature of the narratives has prevented their use for surveillance purposes. We used a validated text mining methodology on 492,393 police-attended domestic violence event narratives from 2005 to 2016 to extract mental health mentions on persons of interest (POIs) (individuals suspected/charged with a domestic violence offense) and victims, abuse types, and victim injuries. A significant increase was observed in events that recorded an injury type (28.3% in 2005 to 35.6% in 2016). The pattern of injury and abuse types differed between male and female victims with male victims more likely to be punched and to experience cuts and bleeding and female victims more likely to be grabbed and pushed and have bruises. The four most common mental illnesses (alcohol abuse, bipolar disorder, depression schizophrenia) were the same in male and female POIs. An increase from 5.0% in 2005 to 24.3% in 2016 was observed in the proportion of events with a reported mental illness with an increase between 2005 and 2016 in depression among female victims. These findings demonstrate that extracting information from police narratives can provide novel insights into domestic violence patterns including confounding factors (e.g., mental illness) and thus enable policy responses to address this significant public health problem.

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al. (2022b), offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards “self-improvement” by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.

Modern S&T electronic abstract databases such as Science Citation Index and INSPEC provide comprehensive information on research activities in many different domains. These databases mostly include English language publications. However for a country such as Thailand which does not use English as the primary language, some S&T information is represented in Thai language as well. Hence to reflect the whole R&D activities in the country, there is a need to extract intelligence from both English and Thai language research publications. In this paper, we describe our ongoing project to consolidate research content focusing on Thai language. We present a framework called Thailand's Research Information Portal and Search Engine (ThaiReSearch) which integrates research information from various databases such as researchers, research projects, patent records, and publications. The framework also provides an intelligent information analysis module which incorporates the following functions: statistical analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and text mining.

This study aims to explore the emotional attitudes of Chinese netizens toward the COVID-19 opening-up policies and their related thematic characteristics. Using Python, 145,851 texts were collected from the Weibo platform. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques were employed to reveal the distribution of public emotions and key themes. The study found that the proportions of emotions were as follows: Good (46%), Happy (11%), Anger (17%), Disgust (6%), Sadness (10%), Surprise (2%), and Fear (8%). Through topic analysis, the following main themes were identified: medical resource shortages, healthcare workers, national policies, and COVID-19 sequelae. Based on the results of sentiment and topic analysis, public emotions toward the COVID-19 opening-up policies were categorized into three dimensions: panic, trust, and acceptance. Panic was primarily associated with medical resource shortages, concerns about COVID-19 sequelae, and doubts about policy transparency and fairness. Trust was reflected in public gratitude toward healthcare workers and support for national policies. Acceptance represented the public’s optimism about returning to normal life. The findings demonstrate that changes in public emotions not only reflect the social impact of policy implementation but also highlight the critical roles of medical resource allocation, information transparency, and psychological health support in adjusting pandemic policies. This study provides empirical evidence and theoretical support for the government to develop more precise pandemic control strategies.

The annotated manifestos are produced by the Comparative Manifesto Project, while the parliamentary speeches annotated with policy areas (subjects) have been recently released under CLARIN-DK. In the paper, we investigate how often the seven parties addressed immigration in the manifestos and parliamentary debates, and we analyse both datasets after having applied NLP tools to them. A sentiment analysis tool was run on the manifestos and its results were compared with the manifestos’ annotations, while topic modeling was applied to the parliamentary speeches in order to outline central themes in the immigration debates. Many of the resulting topic groups are related to cultural, religious and integration aspects which were heavily debated by politicians and media when discussing immigration policy during the past decade. Our analyses also show differences and similarities between parties and indicate how the 2015 immigrant crisis is reflected in the two types of data. Finally, we discuss advantages and limitations of our quantitative and tool-based analyses. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This assessment typically covers various aspects (including economic, social, and environmental impacts) and is designed to ensure that policy proposals are well-founded, transparent, and that potential impacts are thoroughly examined before decisions are made. This process is nowadays performed by human experts and requires a significant amount of time. It is also characterized by some subjectivity that makes it difficult for citizens and companies to perceive the process as a transparent one. Moreover, public administration services responsible for LIA recognize significant difficulties in performing a timely and effective impact assessment exercise due to the lack of human and financial resources. To answer this call, this paper presents an artificial intelligence-based system to automatizing part of the impact assessment process, with the specific objective of detecting administrative burdens from transposed EU legislation. The system is built on a fine-tuned, transformer-based architecture leveraging transfer learning, making it an innovative tool for automating legislative impact assessment. Comprehensive testing on transposed European legislation demonstrated that the system significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy in what has traditionally been a complex and time-consuming task. © 2025 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The approach is based on science mapping models recently developed in infoscience, being a generalization of the so-called Science Overlay Mapping methodology, referred to as Topic Overlay Mapping (TOM). It is shown that via applications of TOM in visualization, document clustering, time series analysis etc. the in-depth exploration and even the measurement of cognitive complexity and its dynamics is feasible for scientific domains. The methodology allows for an ICT-based understanding of contexts induced by large-scale scientific text collections that deeply enhance and drive further, detailed exploration of their contents (augmented cognition). As a use case, an empirical study is presented, focusing on the discovery of a policy-relevant discourse within SSH based on the proposed toolbox of TOM. © 2014 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study presents an in-depth empirical investigation of this law in 651 Chinese provincial government work reports (2003–2023). Employing natural language processing techniques (including Jieba word segmentation with a custom dictionary) and a double-logarithmic regression model, we analyzed word frequency distributions. Our findings indicate that the Zipf coefficient in these reports is close to 1, confirming general adherence to Zipf’s law. Over the 21-year period, the Zipf coefficient exhibits fluctuations, with a notable inflection point in 2011, after which it follows a consistent upward trend. This shift is likely influenced by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which marked a transition toward more standardized and centralized policy communication. While regional differences among eastern, central, western, and northeastern provinces are minimal, centrally governed municipalities exhibit higher Zipf coefficients than other provincial-level regions. Although our findings largely confirm the applicability of Zipf’s Law to this specific corpus, this study is limited by the exclusion of prefecture- and county-level reports. Future research can address this limitation by incorporating a broader range of administrative levels and by conducting cross-country and cultural comparisons of political documents. Further investigation of alternate quantitative linguistic laws (e.g., Heaps’ Law, Menzerath’s Law) within this corpus is also warranted. © 2025 Yanfang LI.

Various methods are proposed to explore networks generation and evolution mechanism. However, the previous methods usually pay more attention to macroscopic characteristics rather than microscopic characteristics, which may lead to lose much information of individual patterns. Since communication network is associated closely with user behaviours, the model of communication network also takes into consideration the individual patterns. By implicitly labeling each network node with a latent attribute-activity level, we introduce an efficent approach for the simulation and modeling of communication network based on topic model. We illustrate our model on a real-world email network obtained from email logs. Experimental results show that the synthetic network preserves some of the global characteristics and individual behaviour patterns. Besides, due to privacy policy and restricted permissions, it is arduous to collect a real large-scale communication network dataset in a short time. Much research work is constrained by the absence of real large-scale datasets. To address this problem, we can use this model to generate a large-scale synthetic communication network by a small amount of captured communication stream. Moreover, it has linear runtime complexity and can be paralleled easily. © 2016, Science Press.

Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving. There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings.

In disaster management, social media data can be mined to discover public perceptions and concerns on large disaster events. However, converting large data streams into useful information remains a challenge due to the unstructured nature of textual data. ?is study proposes an interactive topic modeling method to analyze microblog data for understanding the dynamics of public expressions immediately a?er a major explosion event. First, we extract topics from microblog message data. In order to test the influence of the number of topics, the topics are detected at multiple levels of granularity by varying the number of topics. Second, these topics are used to detect topical compositions of contents at different time slices and assess the topic evolution over time. The topic evolution patterns are visualized by the streamgraph method to discover informative topics to help to take further actions. Third, since the first-level topics are not informative, we conduct a second-level topic (subtopic) analysis to detect key decision elements by choosing investigation from the first-level topics, a hot focus in any man-made disaster. The results improve our understanding of the topic composition evolution around major man-made disasters and have implications on officials deciding what and when to release formal investigation information to the public. © 2018 is held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Online platforms are faced with the task of moderating abusive content to mitigate societal harm and foster inclusivity. Despite numerous methods developed for automated detection of abusive language, the problem continues to persist. This ongoing challenge necessitates further research and development to enhance the effectiveness of abusive content detection systems and implement proactive measures to create safer and more respectful online space. To address the automatic detection of abusive languages in social media platforms, this paper describes the models submitted by our team - MUCS, to the shared task”Abusive Comment Detection in Tamil and Telugu” at DravidianLangTech - in Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP) 2023. This shared task addresses the abusive comment detection in code-mixed Tamil and Telugu texts, that includes the comments in both native script and romanized script, and romanized Tamil (RTamil) text. Two distinct models: i) AbusiveML - a model implemented utilizing Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) algorithm fed with Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of n-grams of words and character sequences within word boundary (char wb) both in the range (1, 3) and ii) AbusiveTL - a Transfer Learning (TL) approach with three different Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models, for three datasets along with random oversampling to deal with data imbalance, are submitted to the shared task for detecting abusive language in the given code-mixed texts. The AbusiveTL model fared well among these two models, with macro F1 scores of 0.46, 0.74, and 0.49 securing 1st, 1st, and 4th rank for code-mixed Tamil, Telugu, and RTamil texts respectively. © DravidianLangTech 2023 - 3rd Workshop on Speech and Language Technologies for Dravidian Languages, associated with 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2023 - Proceedings.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To understand what does drive public interest in invasive plants in the US, we investigated Google Trends search data from 2010 to 2020 for 209 introduced plant species found in the continental US. Using a phylogenetically-controlled structural equation model, we investigated three hypothesized drivers of interest: (1) plant abundance as quantified by national and state-level occurrence records in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, (2) four key plant traits that might influence plant conspicuousness to the general public: ornamental use, human health risks, monoculture formation, and plants with positive economic value, and (3) media coverage, in particular the volume and sentiment of news articles over the same 10-year period. Public search interest was highest for the most abundant introduced species and those with human health risks, but significantly lower for ornamentals. News coverage was mostly negatively toned and disproportionately focused on a relatively small group of widespread invasive species, with significantly lower and more positively-worded coverage of ornamentals. Ultimately, we suggest that a narrow emphasis on a few highly covered ‘notorious’ invasive plant species, with lower and more positive coverage of ornamental introduced species, could send mixed messages and weaken public awareness of the threats of biological invasions. However, the generally strong linkages between public search interest and media coverage of invasive plants suggests ample opportunity to improve messaging and increase public awareness. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It shapes well-rounded personalities, fosters innovation, and cultivates responsible citizens, contributing to social stability and national development. Our research aims to establish an evaluation system for college student mental health education policies based on the Policy Modeling Consistency Index (PMC-Index) model and text mining techniques, quantitatively assessing 15 representative policies. Method: This paper first retrieves policy documents through specialized policy databases and government websites, excluding policies that have already expired or become invalid. The sample selections of this research range from 2001 to 2024, including national guidelines and specific actions. Referring to the above steps of policy effectiveness evaluation, our research comprehensively analyses the implementation effectiveness of the foregoing policies regarding mental health curricula, service systems, crisis intervention, and family cooperation. In the following, based on 10 major variables, 38 sub-variables are constructed with a binary coding system to quantify the content of policy for objectivity. Then, the ROSTCM 6.0 software is used for text segmentation and word frequency statistics, meanwhile, keywords and semantic networks of core policies will be considered for analysis. Subsequently, the PMC-Index is computed based on the multi-input–output matrix and a diagram of the PMC-Surface is drawn with the help of MATLAB to express policy consistency and deficiencies in different dimensions intuitively. Results: Among the 15 policies, 11 exhibit Great Consistency (GC), and 4 fall under Acceptable Consistency (AC). Higher scores are found in Policy Function (X6), Policy Evaluation (X8), and Policy Goals (X9), indicating practical implementation and clear guidance. However, lower scores in Policy Nature (X1), Policy Timeliness (X2), Policy Issuing Agency (X3), and Policy Object (X4) reveal deficiencies in policy innovation, long-term planning, and target group coverage. Particularly, short-term policies lack sustainability, limiting their long-term effectiveness in supporting students’ mental health. Through PMC-Surface analysis, it is found that lower scores in timeliness and adaptability to target groups are primary factors contributing to surface depressions in the diagram, suggesting that these policies struggle to meet the diverse needs of different types of higher education institutions. The research also highlights significant areas for improvement in resource allocation, support system construction, and personalized mental health services. Some policies fail to address regional disparities, with weaker implementation in underdeveloped areas and insufficient safeguard mechanisms. Discussion: In the future, long-term planning for policy optimization is expected, in which priority would be given to localized resource allocation and close collaboration among schools, families, and society to ensure the comprehensiveness and sustainability of mental health education services. The research has identified certain strengths and weaknesses in the policies concerning mental health education for college students in China, thus providing theoretical references and specific recommendations that can be effectively implemented in higher education institutions.

Conflicts within the commission and legislative amendments in trilogues\n                    ABSTRACT: This article aims to examine the effect of intra‐institutional conflicts in the European Commission on the extent of changes made to legislative proposals in trilogue negotiations. We develop and test three hypotheses related to how conflicts within the Commission, namely that intra‐institutional disagreements during policy formulation (h1), and potential conflicts with previous (h2) or subsequent (h3) colleges of commissioners, increase the number of amendments to the Commission’s proposal adopted in trilogues. To test our hypotheses, we use a new dataset measuring the number of changes between Commission proposals and adopted legislation for 216 legislative acts negotiated between 2012 and 2019 by means of text‐mining techniques. It is important to note that we control for differences between the Commission’s proposals and the co‐legislators’ positions in order to distinguish between an effect on preferences anticipation and on the negotiations proper. Our results indicate that intra‐institutional conflicts affect the Commission’s anticipation of the co‐legislators’ positions. The effect on its behaviour in trilogues, that is, after the legislative proposal has been tabled, is less clear. Regarding the latter, only the number of Directorates‐General involved is significantly linked with the number of amendments tabled. These findings suggest that while intra‐institutional disagreements affect the Commission’s role in trilogues, the range of preferences is more important than the intensity of conflicts. © 2021 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study evaluated the magnitude and pattern of AV parking-related crashes that occurred between January 2017 and August 2022 in California. The study applied descriptive analysis, unsupervised text mining, and supervised text mining (Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logitboost, Random Forest, and Neural network) with resampling techniques. It was indicated that parking-related crashes constitute about 16% of all AV crashes, most of them are likely to impact the AV on the rear or left side. The unsupervised text mining results showed that AVs in the conventional mode of operation, reversing, and parallel parking are among the key themes associated with parking-related crashes. The Support Vector Machine, Logitboost, Random Forest, and Neural network showed relatively high prediction accuracy. The important features from these supervised text mining approaches were conventional mode, reservsing, passenger vehicle, parallel parking, which confirm the preliminary findings in the unsupervised text mining. The implications of the findings to operators and policymakers are included in the study. Findings from this paper could be used to introduce measures to reduce AV parking-related crashes. © 2023, Lund University Faculty of Engineering.

We explore what these distinct voices tell us about the EU's legal and policy priorities using a mega corpus compiling more than 200,000 legislative acts, 55,000 court rulings and opinions, and 4,000 articles from a leading EU law journal. Applying an unsupervised machine learning technique known as probabilistic topic modelling, we find that economic integration remains the focus of EU law, but that scholars tend to emphasize rights issues more and ignore certain topics, such as farming regulations, almost entirely. The relationship among these partly interdependent, partly autonomous voices, we suggest, can be conceptualized in terms of co-evolution. Legislation influences issue attention on the CJEU, which, in turn, influences what law professors choose to write about.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Using Chinese listed firms' data, this study measures digital transformation at the firm level from 2010 to 2020, investigating its impact on pollution emissions. The findings show that digital transformation can significantly reduce firms' pollution emissions, and the results remain robust when digital transformation is decomposed into technology-driven, application-innovative and policy-oriented digitalisation based on different calibres. Further investigation reveals that green technology innovation, factor allocation efficiency and environmental information disclosure are the potential mechanisms of digital transformation on reducing pollution emissions. Moreover, digital transformation has obvious heterogeneous effects on firms' pollution emissions based on differing external macro-environments and internal micro-characteristics, and these effects can be moderated by firms' performance evaluation and exogenous policy shocks. In addition, no evidence of a nonlinear relationship between digital transformation and firms' pollution emissions is found. These findings provide comprehensive new evidence with implications for firms and policymakers to promote digital transformation to advance pollution emissions reduction. © 2023\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Whether new technologies can reverse the trend depends on the scope of their impact and scale of their adoption—two dimensions of technical change that are historically difficult to measure. Here, we elaborate on the materials and methods presented in Alexopoulos's presidential address at the 2024 Canadian Economics Association meeting. Specifically, we discuss how applying natural language processing and text mining to library collections and cataloguing materials can help: (i) identify new technologies as they come to market and (ii) track their uses and spread over time. We further describe how our insights can be used to uncover general purpose technologies and macro-innovations in both the past and the present. An application to current data suggests that AI and robotics are responsible for an increasing share of recent technical change. Moreover, they resemble past early-stage general purpose technologies and thus do promise a reversal in productivity trends as their adoption increases. Going forward, our new methods should be especially useful to economists and policy-makers who need to track future development and adoption of key technologies—especially during periods of rapid innovation. © 2024 The Author(s).

This paper has made significant innovations and breakthroughs in policy data and policy analysis methods, analyzing the evolution characteristics of China’s tourism policy system from a new perspective. Research shows that: 1. Tourism policies are mainly based on environmental policies, lacking demand-oriented policies, and the rationality of the policy tool structure needs to be improved; 2. The tourism policy covers a comprehensive range of aspects, including macroeconomic regulation, market regulation, innovative development, and construction. Research suggests that tourism policies ensure a high-quality tourism market environment and stimulate the endogenous growth vitality of the tourism economy. In order to reshape the tourism economy in the post pandemic era, demand oriented policies should be improved. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The AILA Methodology, with its various components, applies when risk assessment proceeds exclusively upon information stated in a policy coming as a text document. This scenario is extremely common through small to medium sized institutions. Among the main contributions of this article lies the AILA Entity Extractor, which facilitates the risk assessor in the identification of entities, then of assets, from a given policy. Then, the AILA Classifier automates the assignment of likelihood values to given threats for assets. Moreover, the synergy of AILA with an existing tool for risk assessment demonstrates how to achieve more objective likelihood assignments. AILA is general in support of any risk assessment and, for the sake of demonstration, is applied to assess the privacy risk induced over physical persons by three real-world manufacturers from the automotive domain, namely Toyota, Mercedes and Tesla. AILA is also validated against a risk assessment methodology by ENISA, thereby confirming effectiveness and efficiency of the new methodology (which is dramatically more automated than ENISA's). AILA combines and consolidates together several techniques in an unprecedented fashion, including Natural Language Processing by summarisation and entity recognition, dataset labelling by appeal to the ToS;DR service, and fully-supervised Machine Learning and regression analysis. Finally, to contribute to open knowledge, the general, executable components of AILA, the AILA Entity Extractor and the AILA Classifier are released open source along with the privacy-specific components, the AILA Privacy Dataset and the AILA Privacy Model.  © 2013 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Mitigation practices of physical distancing and sheltering-in-place continue to impose a significant burden on face-to-face healthcare visits. As a result, telehealth adoption and utilization have increased significantly after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services waived telehealth payment requirements. These changes have been rapid and affect both individuals and organizations, ranging from healthcare and technology to news and policy. We turn to Twitter, as a broad-reaching communication platform, to elucidate and characterize Telehealth communication patterns. While different aspects of tweeting about telehealth have been used to answer specific questions, we sought to understand the collective telehealth tweeting behavior as a system of different types of users tweeting with various intent and sentiment. Such an approach combines the typically independent analysis of structure, using social network analysis, and purpose or function of communication, with topic analysis and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we apply a systems-based approach-called hetero-functional graph theory-to comprehensively describe the structure and function of the Twitter Telehealth communication system. We modeled 13 different types of telehealth users and 15 combinations of tweet intent and sentiment, which together describe 195 system capabilities. We applied machine learning to classify individual user tweeting behavior for different classes of telehealth stakeholders. We identified several patterns of longitudinal tweeting behaviors that varied by system form and function. By applying an interdependent methodology to understand both form and function, we provide deeper insights into tweeting behaviors between different classes of stakeholders. In doing so, we achieve a greater understanding of the various needs of different stakeholders, which can be leveraged as a valuable resource in informing more equitable policies as telehealth becomes a more permanent and scaled healthcare delivery service. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Technological innovation system (TIS) studies examined these two issues of legitimacy and guidance of innovation activities by investigating the public discourse with manual media analyses. However, these approaches are time-consuming, prone to subjectivity biases and limited in scope. Therefore, our paper proposes an automatic text analysis methodology based on unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling and lexicon-based sentiment analysis. By processing 3423 German newspaper articles from the Nexis Uni database, we cover the development of battery-electric vehicles (BEV) in Germany from 2009 to 2019 and identify five socio-technical aspects. Our results indicate an intact legitimacy for the TIS, with Usability, R&D, and Industry being legitimate aspects, which also exhibit strong or improving guidance. In contrast, the Infrastructure and Policy aspects have been less legitimate and weak in guidance, suggesting the need for more holistic policy measures and infrastructure expansion to establish a mass market. Our proposed methodology adds to the toolbox of methods to analyze TIS and serves as a monitoring tool to reveal contested aspects and periods in the public discourse. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

More than 721,000 posts collected from Sina Weibo (one of the most popular social media platforms) from January 2017 to August 2023 have been analyzed utilizing an analytical framework comprising statistical and temporal analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic analysis methods. The results reveal a consistent upward trend in public interest since 2018, with high engagement from the media, education, and institutional sectors, and greater interest from women and younger Weibo users. Economically developed regions with supportive policies and flat terrain, such as Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai, exhibit a higher level of public attention. Sentiment analysis indicates an overall positive public attitude, primarily driven by discounted monthly passes, but there are negative sentiments arising from improper parking management practices. The results are expected to be helpful for improving the SB system and informing relevant policy-making. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, in real-world situations, it can be difficult to find large datasets, particularly in the biomedical field, where it is challenging to retrieve the required material from which to derive the examples to be annotated and where a domain expert is required for annotations. To address this challenge, data augmentation can be used to generate synthetic data from an existing few-shot training set. However, current methods have a tendency to generate a vast amount of noise, thus hindering performance improvements. In this work, we propose a framework to refine a policy that allows the selection of the most informative examples in an augmented pool with a Policy-based Active Learning approach that employs a deep Q-network to define the selection strategy. We experimented the proposed approach on three benchmark biomedical datasets by simulating few-shot scenarios and found it to be more effective than the selected baselines in most of the cases. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

WHO, a global health organization agency, monitored the status of countries air pollution and health effects on human. Recently WHO provided data that depicted that about 99% of the world population lived where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were violated. As a result of global estimation, about 4.2 million premature deaths are caused by outdoor air pollution. In India 1.7 million died due to air pollution in 2019. There are numerous studies such as epidemiological, toxicological and clinicals report showed that outdoor air pollution is significantly associated with various health effects such as eye and nose irritation, allergic rhinitis, sore throat, chronic cough, bronchitis, sinusitis, chest dyspnoea, bronchial asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, reproductive disorder, effects on child cognitive function, Alzheimers disease and so many others like oxidative stress, change in gene expression etc. In this study text mining analyser was used to find out the major health effects caused by outdoor air pollution. The asthma, cardiovascular disease, coughing, COPD, other respiratory disorder, immune system damage and oxidative stress are the major health effects on human due to exposure of outdoor air pollution. The study aims to raise awareness among readers, educators, students, and policymakers about the sources and health impacts of outdoor air pollution, fostering informed decision-making and policy development for addressing this pressing issue. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

The lessons learned by Japan, the technological developments that emerged and the policy measures Japan devised to cope with its pollution are shared widely with Asian countries that now face severe water pollution associated with economic growth. However, this information has been basically qualitative in nature. In this paper we discuss the potential of using patent data and perform analyses to substantiate the insights such data can yield in order to provide more quantitative information on historical trends in the development of essential technologies in this field. Specifically, we demonstrate an approach using patent data to verify the historical development of wastewater and sewage sludge treatment technologies over the past 50 years in Japan. We examined relevant patent data from 1961 onward and addressed technological development trends in relation to societal changes and the implementation of governmental policies during that period. As an example of the substantiating analysis, we applied principal component analysis and text mining to review the trends in a systematic manner. We demonstrate that the emergence of such developments can be closely associated with societal background factors such as the adoption of relevant governmental policies. We argue that this kind of patent data analysis, coupled with other essential data, can yield clues to the evolution of relevant technologies in the past, leading to useful implications for environmental management of economically developing nations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Availability and affordance of information communications technology has provided additional medium to monitor human rights violation. Reporting, extraction, collection and verification of reports through natural language processing and machine learning techniques can now be integrated into one system. The processed narratives becomes readily available for response, monitoring, interventions, policy-making and even as evidence in court. This paper discusses the design and development of wapr.tugon.ph, a block-chain enabled NLP-based platform that provides a simple yet effective way of reporting, validating and securing human rights violation reports from victims or witnesses. wapr.tugon.ph allows for SMS-based and web-based reporting of human rights violation. Reports are processed for detection of emotions using NRCLex, and behaviors using Stanford Parser and modified Multi-Liason algorithm from narratives which serve as input to assess wellness. A total of 5,418 records were obtained from Reddit’s subreddits and HappyDB corpus to serve as baseline corpora for our model. Our best psychosocial wellness detection model produced an accuracy and F1 score of 84% on validation set (n = 1, 426) and 87% on test set (n = 666). An ethereum private blockchain is implemented to record all transactions made in the system for authenticity tracking. Findings underscore the importance of providing a system that assists in determining the appropriate psychosocial intervention to victims, families and witnesses of human rights violation. Specifically, the study contributes a framework in embedding a combined sentiment and behavior model that outputs: sentiments that are used to assess mental wellness, behaviors that are used to assess physical needs, and detection of wellness that serves as input to refer victims, families of victims and witnesses to appropriate agencies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

E-petitions may be viewed as a natural laboratory for determining subjects of public interest, and thus can be used by policy analysts to understand social needs and constraints. In this paper, we introduce textual analysis tools (such as NER and topic modeling) and extract three types of novel variables (informativeness, named entities, and 21 topics) from We the People petition texts. The regression result shows that informativeness, named location, and several topics are significantly correlated with the log of the signature counts. These exploratory but promising results indicate that textual analysis tools can complement traditional statistical methods by providing descriptive measures that are helpful for making causal inferences from electronic petition data. These new tools, we believe, will facilitate policy analysis and policy informatics by enabling meaningful use of large volumes of online archives containing public expression regarding policy preferences.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study investigates the impact of SCP symbol content on engagement, emotional responses, and trust in electoral process in TikTok-based anti-disinformation campaigns during Taiwanese 2024 general elections. Utilizing advanced natural language processing and machine learning, we analyzed posts and comments, categorizing them for presence and type of SCP symbols. We employed a multi-faceted approach, examining engagement metrics, emotional responses, and trust evaluations across different symbol categories. Our novel categorization ranged from content without symbols to those incorporating multiple symbol types, providing nuanced understanding of symbolic influence. Findings reveal a strong positive correlation between the complexity of symbolic content and user engagement, with cultural symbols emerging as potent in driving interaction and fostering trust. Emotional analysis showed symbol-rich content elicited more positive emotional responses, especially with cultural symbols. Trust evaluations showed increases in symbol diversity increased trust, with cultural and political symbols generating the highest trust levels towards Taiwan’s democratic and electoral process. Statistical validation through non-parametric tests confirmed that the observed effects were not artifacts of data distribution or follower count variations. Our findings have significant implications for public affairs, strategic communications, policymakers, and platform managers, providing a framework for crafting more effective, culturally resonant content in digital socio-political campaigns. This study also opens avenues for further research into the long-term effects of symbolic communication on political behavior and democratic participation in the digital age. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The quantity of studies done on this subject has experienced significant growth. This study aims to provide an overview of this field by conducting a systematic review of literature that focuses on automatic hate speech identification, particularly in the Arabic language. The goal is to examine the research trends in Arabic hate speech identification and offer guidance to researchers by highlighting the most significant studies published between 2018 and 2023. This systematic study addresses five specific research questions concerning the types of the Arabic language used, hate speech categories, classification techniques, feature engineering techniques, performance metrics, validation methods, existing challenges faced by researchers, and potential future research directions. Through a comprehensive search across nine academic databases, 24 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria and quality assessment were identified. The review findings revealed the existence of many Arabic linguistic varieties used in hate speech on Twitter, with modern standard Arabic (MSA) being the most prominent. In identification techniques, machine learning categories are the most used technique for Arabic hate speech identification. The result also shows different feature engineering techniques used and indicates that N-gram and CBOW are the most used techniques. F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy were also identified as the most used performance metric. The review also shows that the most used validation method is the train/test split method. Therefore, the findings of this study can serve as valuable guidance for researchers in enhancing the efficacy of their models in future investigations. Besides, algorithm development, policy rule regulation, community management, and legal and ethical consideration are other real-world applications that can be reaped from this research.

Perhaps the most well-known SEL framework is the model provided by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL). This framework has become the dominant framework informing state SEL standards, which guide educators’ SEL related practice. Yet, the content of these standards has not been formally examined for alignment with the CASEL framework. The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the content of CASEL-based state standards to explore how the CASEL framework is translated into school-based practice and to understand what SEL skills are valued by states. Using text mining and network analysis, we identified SEL standard content that was consistent across nine states and examined relationships within and across CASEL domains. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. Impact Statement Social and emotional learning (SEL) practices have grown in prominence and utility in schools across grade levels. The CASEL framework is commonly used to inform SEL intervention, assessment, and, more recently, state standards. We evaluated the content of SEL state standards created using the CASEL framework to explore how states have implemented CASEL’s model. We describe how states’ interpretations of CASEL domains may inform further scientific grounding of SEL-focused research, policy, and practice. © 2022 National Association of School Psychologists.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Methods: We conducted an observational longitudinal descriptive analysis involving 320 patients, who were grouped into intervention and control groups over a 24-month period. Results: The 3E model demonstrated significant cost reductions, with the intervention group achieving a 74.3% decrease in total costs compared to 41.8% in the control group while maintaining the same level of glycemic control. Machine learning models, including random forest and K-means clustering, were used to identify key factors influencing treatment costs and to segment patient subgroups that were most responsive to the intervention. Natural language processing techniques revealed medication patterns associated with greater cost reductions. Long-term projections using ensemble methods (such as XG Boost, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet) predicted that, on average, each year contributes approximately 20% to the total cumulative savings over 5 years. No significant correlations were observed between cost reduction and socioeconomic factors, gender, or age, suggesting the broad applicability of the 3E model. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the potential of the 3E model to achieve significant reductions in diabetes management costs without compromising care quality, highlighting its value for healthcare policy and resource allocation in chronic disease management.

This study systematically reviews 4647 journal papers to uncover evolving research themes and regional disparities in household carbon emissions research. We identified a marked increase in publications after 2015 and, using natural language processing, defined 7 distinct research clusters. While earlier studies focused primarily on energy consumption, more recent research has broadened to encompass a range of topics, including food systems, supply-chain emissions, and renewable energy. Our regional analysis reveals varied levels of research engagement across countries. The Global South is increasingly involved, focusing on cooking facilities and household energy use, whereas Europe emphasizes policy-oriented mitigation. North America, led by the United States, focuses on transportation emissions and residential energy-efficiency modeling, while Asian countries examine urban-rural disparities and household inequality. Drawing on these thematic and geographical insights, this study identifies current knowledge gaps, such as the need for cross-regional comparisons and supply chain integration. These insights offer actionable directions to promote sustainable consumption practices and support global climate goals. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Federal and state policies increasingly require plans to assess and incorporate EJ principles. The current lack of accessible data and plan evaluation on EJ has been a barrier to policy setting and benchmarking. We created a framework for analyzing content across a large corpus of plans by using quantitative text analysis on 461 California city general plans, also known as comprehensive plans. To verify results and identify specific policies, we conducted content analysis on a subset of seven plans. Demonstrating the broad applicability of EJ principles in planning, policies spanned all required elements of general plans: housing, circulation, land use, health, safety, open space, air quality, and noise. We found that the most headway in EJ planning has been made in cities with a majority population of color and well before the 2018 California state mandate to address EJ. Policies were primarily focused on preventing adverse exposures as opposed to correcting for legacies of inequality. Further, although all policies address vulnerable populations and places, very few specifically address race or racism. Thus, EJ has been largely operationalized as health equity. Takeaway for practice: We identified 628 EJ policies focused on vulnerable populations across the seven city plans included in content analysis. The smorgasbord of policy approaches provides fodder for cities across the United States to incorporate an EJ approach to planning. Gaps in focus areas reveal room for policy innovation (e.g., emphasis on language justice, formerly incarcerated individuals, and noise ordinance policing). We invite planners and community advocates to search across California’s plans for EJ policy inspiration and to use the appendix of EJ policies cataloged in this research as a benchmark of city-level innovation. © 2022 The Author(s).

Considering the uncertainty about policies, health risks, financial difficulties, etc. the online media, especially the Twitter platform, is experiencing a high volume of activity related to this pandemic. Among the hot topics, the polarized debates about unconfirmed medicines for the treatment and prevention of the disease have attracted significant attention from online media users. In this work, we present a stance data set, COVID-CQ, of user-generated content on Twitter in the context of COVID-19. We investigated more than 14 thousand tweets and manually annotated the tweet initiators’ opinions regarding the use of “chloroquine” and “hydroxychloroquine” for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, COVID-CQ is the first data set of Twitter users’ stances in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the largest Twitter data set on users’ stances towards a claim, in any domain.

Policy makers are utilizing social distancing and isolation policies to reduce the risk of transmission and spread of COVID-19, while the research, development, and testing of antiviral treatments and vaccines are ongoing. As part of these isolation policies, in-person healthcare delivery has been reduced, or eliminated, to avoid the risk of COVID-19 infection in high-risk and vulnerable populations, particularly those with comorbidities. Clinicians, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists have traditionally relied on in-person diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) and neurological conditions and illnesses. The assessment and rehabilitation of persons with acute and chronic conditions has, therefore, been particularly impacted during the pandemic. This article presents a perspective on how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), can be used to assist with assessment and rehabilitation for acute and chronic conditions. © Copyright © 2021 Carriere, Shafi, Brehon, Pohar Manhas, Churchill, Ho and Tavakoli.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We developed an accurate and comprehensive oil spill database covering incidents from 2002 to 2023 by integrating satellite synthetic aperture radar imagery with deep learning segmentation models. A key innovation of our approach is cross-referencing satellite-detected spills with media reports, enhancing detection accuracy while revealing significant underreporting of spills in media outlets. Our approach demonstrates the potential of merging technological innovations with media analytics to improve environmental monitoring effectiveness and inform policy-making for sustainable marine ecosystems. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Nevertheless, there are no conclusive findings on online citizen participation and inclusive policymaking. This study adds in line with the discussion with a fresh perspective of institutional bias. It presents new evidence by examining the process, participants, policy agenda, and sentiments of public opinions from the government-led and Internet-empowered citizen participation regarding the 2017–2035 Shanghai Master Plan. Four findings are reported based on the in-depth case study with text and sentiment analysis. First, the government-led model provides institutionalized opportunities for citizen engagement throughout the policy process, while the Internet-empowered citizen participation is characterized by contingency and ad hoc. Second, the government-led model remains elite-dominated, while the Internet empowers a wider scope of stakeholders with an open and popularized participation platform. Third, the public opinion from the Internet-empowered model often goes beyond or even against the pre-defined official principles and goals. In contrast, the civic discussion in the government-led model influences policy by changing the sequence of policy agenda or providing focus within the official setting. Fourth, citizens, especially the experts, are more likely to give positive feedback in the government-led model than the Internet-empowered approach. These findings confirm and identify the remaining institutional bias that hinders inclusive policymaking in the Internet age. Theoretically, it reminds scholars to examine the institutional arrangements regarding citizen participation carefully. Practically, it indicates that the central government could facilitate inclusive policymaking at the local level by reducing the institutional bias of the government-led approach and utilizing text and sentiment analysis to urge the local government's response to Internet-empowered public opinion. © 2023\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Social media platforms permit users to exchange opinions freely, which, while fostering open discourse, can also trigger instances of cyberbullying. This study focusses on Twitter discourses related to Indonesia's contentious public policy, Cipta Kerja. The inherent polarity of views towards this policy has given rise to instances of cyberbullying. An extensive dataset comprising 2400 tweets was meticulously assembled, employing the keyword Cipta Kerja. This dataset was subsequently partitioned into training and testing subsets to facilitate cyberbullying detection through computational algorithms. Sentiment analysis played a crucial role in this process, with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method demonstrating remarkable reliability in classifying sentiment-related issues and, therefore, detecting cyberbullyings. The SVM method, using a linear kernel function, achieved a commendable accuracy rate of 92.7% in cyberbullying detection. This study's results underscore the effectiveness of SVM in identifying instances of cyberbullying on social media platforms, offering new promise for safeguarding digital spaces. © 2023 WITPress.

This study quantified online negative sentiment using micro-blog text mining and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) to empirically analyze the dynamic impact of negative public emotions on agricultural product prices during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It was found that the online negative sentiment impacted agricultural products prices during COVID-19 and had significant time-varying, lag, and life cycle characteristics, with the responses being most significant in the spread and recession periods. Differences were found in the price responses for different agricultural products and in different risk areas. The online negative sentiment was found to have the greatest impact on vegetable prices, with livestock products and vegetable prices being mainly positively impacted, fruit prices being mainly negatively impacted, and aquatic product prices being negatively impacted in the early stage and positively impacted in the middle and late stages. The online negative sentiment had the greatest impact on medium-risk area agricultural product prices, followed by low-risk areas, with the lowest impact found on the high-risk area agricultural product prices. Three policy suggestions for epidemic monitoring, public opinion guidance and control, and the timely release of agricultural product information are given based on the results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Despite these advances, current human preference datasets are either prohibitively expensive to construct or suffer from a lack of diversity in preference dimensions, resulting in limited applicability for instruction tuning in open-source text-to-image generative models and hinder further exploration. To address these challenges, we first leverage multimodal large language models to create VisionPrefer, a fine-grained preference dataset that captures multiple preference aspects (prompt-following, aesthetic, fidelity, and harmlessness). Then we train a corresponding reward model, VP-Score, over VisionPrefer to guide the tuning of text-to-image generative models. The preference prediction accuracy of VP-Score is validated to be comparable to that of human annotators. To validate the effectiveness of VisionPrefer and VP-Score, we adopt two reinforcement learning methods, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), to supervised fine-tune generative models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that VisionPrefer significantly improves text-image alignment in compositional image generation across diverse aspects, e.g., aesthetic, and generalizes better than previous human-preference metrics across various image distributions. Our findings indicates that the integration of AI-generated synthetic data as a supervisory signal is a promising avenue for achieving improved alignment with human preferences in text-to-image generative models.

This theoretical construct enables an intricate examination of interactions within various environmental systems, emphasizing micro, meso, exo, macro, and chrono systems. Specifically, it illuminates the dynamics within immediate settings, interconnections among diverse systems, broader indirect influences, cultural ideologies, societal values, and temporal dimensions, offering a comprehensive lens for understanding educational contexts. The descriptive qualitative research was conducted within a case study framework to explore the practical experiences of stakeholders within ECD using semi-structured interview guides. Ethical standards were upheld, ensuring voluntary participation and confidentiality. Purposive sampling was used to collect data from diverse and knowledgeable participants involved in ECD domains, providing comprehensive insights aligned with the study’s objectives. Thematic analysis and sentiment mining were performed using Atlas 23 software. The results revealed themes such as recruitment practices relying on community-driven approaches, role ambiguity due to undefined responsibilities, informal evaluation processes, inconsistent training opportunities, and a dependency on community and volunteerism. These themes highlight the absence of formal structures and standardized processes in various aspects of ECD programs. Additionally, sentiment analysis illustrated diverse perspectives among stakeholders, reflecting their distinct experiences and challenges within the ECD landscape. The study concludes with policy recommendations aimed at addressing these systemic challenges. © 2025 Banda et al.

Focusing on the European Union, this article studies whether this is the case and, if so, when the European Commission responds to public opinion when pursuing policy integration. It argues that the Commission has legitimacy incentives encouraging it to be responsive but politicisation can suppress responsiveness by transmitting competing demands on the Commission from the member states’ citizens. To test these arguments, the contribution applied automated text analysis to estimate the European Union (EU) authority expansion entailed in the Commission’s legislative proposals between 2009 and 2019 and analysed its correspondence with public preferences over EU policy action across the EU states, measured using the Eurobarometer. The results lend support to the hypotheses and suggest that politicisation can undermine the responsiveness of international institutions. © 2024 The Author(s).

[Design/ Methodology] This paper comprehensively used the methods of network research and text mining. The content mining software, KH Coder, was employed to conduct quantitative text analysis of 79 data policies from 20 data centers. Through analyzing the frequency of FAIR principle appear in these policy texts and the words with high similarity used in FAIR principle of these policy texts, we revealed the attention difference and semantic feature of FAIR principle in different data centers and different types of policy texts. [Findings/Conclusion] The results show that the data policies of data centers have reflected some FAIR principles, but the attention to each principle is not balanced. Different types of data policies focus on different aspects of the FAIR principle, and the commonality lies in the findable principle and interoperable principle and a strong emphasis is given to metadata. [Originality/Value] This paper suggests that in the development of data policy, National Scientific Data Centers should highlight the role of metadata in data lifecycle management, promote the construction of data policy system driven by data value-added and appropriately introduce the FAIR principle based on the scientific data management practice in China. © 2024 Editorial Office of Documentation, Information and Knowledge.

Most studies of policy diffusion—which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments—have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas. ©2020, Midwest Political Science Association\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

VPA applications (or VPA apps for short) are accompanied by a privacy policy document that informs users of their data handling practices. These documents are usually lengthy and complex for users to comprehend, and developers may intentionally or unintentionally fail to comply with them. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the privacy policy compliance issue of VPA apps. We develop Skipper, which targets Amazon Alexa skills. It automatically depicts the skill into the declared privacy profile by analyzing their privacy policy documents with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, and derives the behavioral privacy profile of the skill through a black-box testing. We conduct a large-scale analysis on all skills listed on Alexa store, and find that a large number of skills suffer from the privacy policy noncompliance issues.  © 2022 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A unified quantitative analysis of policy intensity can shed light on the policy evolution across different levels, the influence of partisan and regional factors on policy, and the relationships with emissions of major pollutants. By harnessing the policy text of the Clean Air Act (CAA) at the federal level and State Implementation Plans (SIPs) at the state governments (1955–2020), we deployed a Natural Language Processing approach to define a policy intensity index to systematically quantify the US air policy landscape. Our findings highlight that the 1970 CAA amendment carries the most vigorous intensity as it established a holistic control system for the first time. Subsequent years witnessed a general trend of partisan polarization, eventually leading to a graduate convergence between red and blue states. Blue states demonstrated a closer alignment with federal directives and a superior efficacy in pollutant reduction. Regionally, the Northeast displays the highest overall policy intensity, and the West exhibits the highest coordination with the federal benchmarks, making these regions outperform others in air pollution control. Our study not only discusses policy implications for air pollutant reductions considering partisan and regional differences but also provides a novel measurement tool to quantify policies for assessing disparities and synergies. © The Author(s) 2024.

In the past decades, a large number of academic articles in the maritime transport field have been published. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the development of maritime transport research. A structural topic model (STM) is adopted to analyze the research themes and trends in the maritime literature. STM is a text mining-based methodology to uncover main topics from large-scale unstructured textual data. In total, 3199 articles published between Jan 1991 and Aug 2020 were collected and analyzed. The results show that the major academic concerns of maritime transport are related to port management, container operations and liner shipping management. The overall research trends have shifted from regulations and policy management to efficient, integrated and sustainable maritime transport over the past few decades. The main research topics and emerging trends discovered from STM can facilitate researchers, funding groups and policymakers for identifying contemporary research issues and making more informed decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using new data and state-of-the-art methodology, our study provides a fresh perspective on this fundamental question. We focus on a multi-party parliamentary system, specifically the Canadian House of Commons, with a specific emphasis on the issue of climate change. To assess the attention given by political parties to various policy issues, we analyze transcripts from the Question Period spanning from April 2006 to June 2021. To gauge the public’s level of concern for these issues, we incorporate data obtained from Google Trends. Employing an instrumental variable estimation strategy, our study causally estimates the extent to which the public salience of climate change influences elite attention. Our findings reveal that the public salience of climate change significantly influences the attention given to this issue by parties, albeit with noticeable partisan variations. Moreover, our research highlights the effectiveness of the Question Period in compelling the government to address challenging or potentially embarrassing issues. Lastly, we uncover evidence suggesting that the Liberal Party of Canada successfully increased the public salience of climate change during its tenure in government. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Quantitative analysis of policies related to rural digital construction can provide important bases for the formulation and improvement of policies in the future. This paper adopts text mining method and combines social network analysis to study 213 digital village construction policy texts issued by national government departments from 2007 to 2021, and deeply analyzes the content characteristics and evolution rules of such policies. The results show that several small cooperative groups have been formed among the policy issuing agencies. They gradually refine the specific arrangements and measures of rural digitization construction on the basis of division of labor and cooperation. With the promotion of digital information technology, the government's formulation of policies related to rural digital construction has formed a change process from point to point. The policy focus has changed from agriculture to smart agriculture, emerging industry and information service industry, making the policy coverage more comprehensive and more in line with the actual situation of local villages. In the future, policies related to digital village construction pay more attention to the difficulties of development and the consolidation of construction achievements while comprehensively developing.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Sifting through the revision history of the articles that at some point had been considered biased and later corrected, we retrieve the last tagged and the first untagged revisions as the before/after snapshots of what was deemed a violation of Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy. We extract the sentences that were removed or rewritten in that edit. The approach yields sufficient data even in the case of relatively small Wikipedias, such as the Bulgarian one, where 62k articles produced 5k biased sentences. We evaluate our method by manually annotating 520 sentences for Bulgarian and French, and 744 for English. We assess the level of noise and analyze its sources. Finally, we exploit the data with well-known classification methods to detect biased sentences.

However, it is difficult but critical to measure the effectiveness of these policies. This paper proposed a quantitative evaluation approach to the effectiveness of construction industrialization policies, based on five policies passed from 2014 to 2017. These policies were first quantified through text mining. Then, the policy modeling consistency (PMC) index was employed to inform the effectiveness and efficiency of the studied policies. Findings of this paper can be used as references for policy making in construction industrialization. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Gendered Media Coverage of the 2020 Democratic Party Presidential Primaries\n                    ABSTRACT: In the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary campaigns, six women, the most in history, announced their candidacy for the presidency. Using computational topic modeling and network analysis of 84,000 newspaper articles (2.2 million paragraphs), we analyze how gender and electability was discussed during the Primaries. Results reveal that male candidates, and especially Joe Biden, were frequently compared with the incumbent, Donald Trump, while coverage of female candidates focused directly on social policy. Trump’s attack on Biden during the impeachment process produced a lasting effect by promoting discourse topics traditionally dominated by men. This crowded out the topics emphasized by women, such as health care and education. Women candidates’ press coverage was also more reactionary than men’s. Although explicit reference to gender as a discourse topic has decreased, which suggests growing gender parity within the political process, gendered policy salience emerges transitively in comparison with the incumbent. Transitive policy salience emerges as a key explanatory variable that articulates the indirect path media coverage can lead to the marginalization of women candidates. © 2023 AEJMC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, there is a lack of scientific evaluation on the rationality and completeness of the provincial special public funding policy of China s private colleges and universities. Therefore, this paper uses PMC-index model and text mining technology to establish an evaluation index system for the provincial special public funding policy of private universities in China. Based on PMCIndex and PMC-Surface, 13 policy texts issued since 2010 were evaluated scientifically. The results show that the average PMC-Index of the 13 policies is 6.97, and the PMC-Surface map is smooth, which indicates that the overall structure of these policies is reasonable and the policy content has certain completeness. Only one policy is unacceptable. Through further analysis, we found that there is still much room for improvement in the content design of the sample policy, and its rationality and completeness are related to the publication time. This study is helpful to fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the provincial special public funding policy of private universities in China. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

This imbalance often favors industries, forcing users to repeatedly define their privacy preferences each time they access a new website. This process contributes to the privacy paradox. We propose a user support tool named the User Privacy Preference Management System (UPPMS) that eliminates the need for users to handle intricate banners or deceptive patterns. We have set up a process to guide even a non-expert user in creating a standardized personal privacy policy, which is automatically applied to every visited website by interacting with cookie banners. The process of generating actions to apply the user’s policy leverages customized Large Language Models. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing HTML code to understand and automatically interact with cookie banners, even implementing complex policies. Our proposal aims to address the privacy paradox related to cookie banners by reducing information overload and decision fatigue for users. It also simplifies user navigation by eliminating the need to repeatedly declare preferences in intricate cookie banners on every visited website, while protecting users from deceptive patterns. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Aside from the usual numeric ratings obtained from the survey, the hierarchical concerns and sentiments can also be identified through the text-based customer feedbacks. These feedbacks contain text about customer experiences with the products offered and services delivered by an institution. A challenge in analyzing unstructured customer feedback is in making sense of the topics that are expressed in words used to describe these experiences. This study develops a model for text analysis of the customer feedbacks that exploits machine learning algorithms such as topic modeling. This further described the text mining process steps undergone in extracting useful information from the customer survey feedbacks of one of the SUCs in the Philippines, The Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology (BISCAST). Moreover, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling method, was used for automatic text summarization and topic extraction from these text-based data. The topmost concerns extracted from the feedbacks were identified. This information provides useful insights for management analysis as well as inputs for policy making. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The impact of Covid-19 has spread to Indonesia, especially in the slowdown in economic growth. This was influenced by the implementation of Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM) which limited community economic activities. This study analyzes the mapping of public sentiment towards PPKM policies in Indonesia during the pandemic based on Twitter data. Knowing the mapping of public sentiment regarding PPKM is expected to help stakeholders in the policy evaluation process for each region. The method used is BERT with IndoBERT specific model. The results showed the evaluation value of the IndoBERT f-1 score reached 84%, precision 86%, and recall 84%. Meanwhile, f-1 scores 70%, 72% precision, and 70% recall for evaluating the use of SVM. Multinominal Naïve Bayes evaluation shows an f-1 score of 83%, precision of 78%, and recall of 80%. In conclusion, the BERT method with the IndoBERT model is proven to be higher than classical methods such as SVM and Multinominal Naïve Bayes. © 2022 Seventh Sense Research Group®\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Swiss National Railways (SBB) uses Facebook to collect commuters’ feedback and opinions. These customer feedbacks are highly valuable to make public transportation option more robust and gain trust of the customer. The objective of this study was to find interesting association rules about SBB’s commuters pain points. We extracted the publicly available FB visitor comments and applied manual text mining by building categories and subcategories on the extracted data. We then applied Apriori algorithm and built multiple frequent item sets satisfying the minsup criteria. Interesting association rules were found. These rules have shown that late trains during rush hours, deleted but not replaced connections on the timetable due to SBB’s timetable optimization, inflexibility of fines due to unsuccessful ticket purchase, led to highly customer discontent. Additionally, a considerable amount of dissatisfaction was related to the policy of SBB during the initial lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic. Commuters were often complaining about lack of efficient and effective measurements from SBB when other passengers were not following Covid-19 rules like public distancing and were not wearing protective masks. Such rules are extremely useful for SBB to better adjust its service and to be better prepared by future pandemics. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The discussion surrounding the application of LLMs in education has raised ethical concerns, particularly concerning plagiarism and policy compliance. Despite the prowess of LLMs in conversational tasks, the limitations of reliability and hallucinations exacerbate the need to guardrail conversations, motivating our investigation of RAG in computer science higher education. We developed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications for the two tasks of virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids. In our study, we collected the ratings and opinions of faculty members in undergraduate and graduate computer science university courses at various levels, using our personalized RAG systems for each course. This study is the first to gather faculty feedback on the application of LLM-based RAG in education. The investigation revealed that while faculty members acknowledge the potential of RAG systems as virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids, certain barriers and features are suggested for their full-scale deployment. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the integration of advanced language models in educational settings, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and the development of appropriate safeguards to ensure responsible and effective implementation. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To address these complexities, a vendor-agnostic, logical, and abstract view of the infrastructure is essential. Intent-based networking (IBN) helps address complexity by providing a set of abstractions (e.g., functional, data, infrastructure), but the intelligent and automatic decomposition of an intent into a course of actions is a challenging task. In this article, we propose a policy-based approach to model functional abstractions, and decompose intents into a hierarchy of policies. We use closed control loop automation, guided by Finite State Machines (FSM) to execute the policies and deploy the intents. To make our approach widely applicable, we provide a mapping to the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Policy Driven Orchestration (PDO) model. We also discuss opportunities for IBN in large language models, and demonstrate our system through a cloud intent that includes a VNF and a health check service.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This work has, however, neglected the question of corporate identity from the perspective of co-operatives—democratically-controlled businesses owned and controlled by their users—and the existential challenge posed by an operating environment often hostile to the business model. At the same time, the question of identity permeates the scholarly organizational and co-operative literature, shaping studies into co-operative identity crises, isomorphism, and from a transactions-cost economics perspective, the co-operative lifecycle. Bridging these literatures, we develop a first-ever conceptual dictionary of terms that we associate with co-operative and investor-owned firms (IOFs). Using text-as-data techniques, we apply the dictionary to a 15-year sample of credit union (a type of co-operative) and bank (IOFs) annual report texts. The resulting model ranks credit unions and banks on a co-op versus IOF firm scale and identifies credit unions that may be at risk of losing their identity because of their use of IOF language. To validate our results, we employ a variety of strategies, including novel machine learning models. Generally, these strategies support the findings from our dictionary model but also suggest the model may not be picking up on some creeping isomorphic pressures on credit unions to conform to IOF language. We conclude by noting that identity questions have important real-world implications, noting potential legal and public policy implications (e.g., loss of preferential tax measures) and pointing to literature that associates co-operative “identity crises” with business failures and demutualizations which, in turn, can lead to higher consumer prices. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic modelling analyses to examine the evolution and trajectory of the climate justice literature. We analyse 1,683 publications covering the period from 1997 to 2021, highlighting foundational works, influential authors, leading nations and institutions, and prevailing research topics within this field. We employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover latent research trends in the literature providing a crucial baseline for future scholarly endeavours and policy development in the realm of climate justice. Our results show that the field of climate justice has grown exponentially from less than 5 papers annually between 1997 and 2005, to around 200 papers annually in recent years. This growth has seen a diversification of research themes with an increase in papers around the topics of health, vulnerability and adaptation, and policy and activism. There has been a consistent backdrop of publications around the topics of sustainable development and policy, and international relations and carbon emissions. Other prominent topics in the literature include education and food security, and human rights and Indigenous people. The field has moved from theoretical research to examining actual examples of climate injustices, with an increased diversification of topics. Future research could usefully focus on exploring future generations and more-than-human entities; the integration of climate justice and climate activism with broader struggles for justice; re-thinking climate adaptation “success” and “effectiveness” through the lens of climate justice, and the ramifications of the Global Goal on Adaptation on climate justice led-approaches that are inclusive, build on human rights approaches, and extend the scale of adaptation analysis beyond the local. It is imperative to prioritise addressing the climate justice needs of those most affected by climate change, transcending national borders, generational gaps, cultural differences, and even the well-being of various species. Such a holistic approach will help inform and refine global climate policy and action. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This article not only leverages the reinforcement learning multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to realize the dynamic decision-making of game AI but also creatively incorporates deep learning and natural language processing technologies in the wargame field to transform game context situation maps into textual suggestions in wargame confrontation. In this article, we effectively integrate reinforcement learning technologies, deep learning technologies, and natural language processing technologies to generalize the semantic text output at state-of-the-art accuracy, which plays an important role in human understanding of game AI behavior. The experimental results are promising and can be used to verify the feasibility, accuracy, and performance of our proposed model in extensive simulations against benchmarking methods. © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Existing research has explored open government data policies from various perspectives, but little attention has been given to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of policy narratives. [Method / process] In this study, we take the example of the United States open government data policy and employ a structural topic model approach to identify policy topics. Subsequently, we use a narrative policy framework to analyze the policy narratives from four dimensions: background, plot, characters, and moral. We also examine the homogeneity and heterogeneity of policy narratives between the federal government and state governments in the United States. [Result / conclusion] The research findings indicate that there are five main policy narratives concerning the US open government data policy, and regional differences in policy narratives exist due to varying economic development levels, geographical locations, and other factors. © 2025 Information studies: Theory and Application.

Where less significant development can be observed is in the area of sponsorship evaluation. This paper outlines a specific company case study focusing on a relatively new, but now well-established brand, which made a significant strategic choice in utilizing sponsorship for brand building, market penetration, and the acquisition and retention of consumers in an increasingly commodified service category in contrast to the strategic mix chosen by its main competitors. The paper provides a detailed focus on the management and evaluation of their sponsorship activity in one particular market. Following a brief introduction to the O2 brand and its international development, it will examine the brand's position in the Irish marketplace and the strategically chosen role for sponsorship in its armory of marketing options. It details the key strategic pillars, which underpin the approach to sponsorship as a set of beliefs that hold sponsorship policy and activation together. The challenge, in a mature market dominated by competition for market share, was to drive short-term sales while building long-term brand equity. The industry was experiencing a paradigm shift from mobile operators to social networks and the paper explains how the choice and activation of sponsorships sought to develop participative interaction with customers to promote emotionally driven loyalty. To make the brand the basis for differentiation the company chose a marketing mix weighted toward sponsorship and placed participation at the core of activation. The strategic choices involved regarding the balance of resources between paid-for media and sponsorship and in the latter case, between assets and activation, are explored. Two case studies relating to sport and entertainment sponsorship are detailed with particular reference to innovative and creative activation through social networks. The paper will outline the use of quantitative tracking measures as well as more involved measures in evaluating sponsorship performance. More specifically it will focus on the measurement of sponsorship performance and in particular on the various points at which measurement is brought to bear and the range of metrics-including softer measures such as sentiment analysis and social media conversations-utilized in this evaluation process. It will thus arrive at a comprehensive approach to measuring sponsorship effectiveness and demonstrate how results are translatable to monetary values. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In reality, these concepts might prioritize certain groups over others. Based on interdisciplinary theories of androcentrism, we hypothesized that (a) person is more associated with men than women (person = man) and (b) woman is more associated with women than man is with men (i.e., women are more gendered: gender = woman). We applied natural language processing tools (specifically, word embeddings) to the linguistic output of millions of individuals (specifically, the Common Crawl corpus). We found the hypothesized person = man / gender = woman bias. This bias was stronger about Hispanic and White (vs. Asian) women and men. We also uncovered parallel biases favoring White individuals in the concepts person, woman, and man. Western society prioritizes men and White individuals as people and “others” women as people with gender, with implications for equity across policy- and decision-making contexts. © 2024 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This application responds to the need for high-quality data on criminal groups to inform academic and policy analysis in a context of intense violence such as Mexico. Powered by ML and NLP tools, this computational social science application processes a vast collection of news stories written in Spanish to track MCOs' violent presence. The unprecedented granularity of the data allows disaggregating daily-municipal information for 10 main MCOs comprising more than 200 specific criminal cells. © 2020 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since knowledge exploration is a resource-intensive task for organizations, untimely or excessive knowledge exploration have detrimental impacts on the innovativeness and competitiveness of organizations. The benefits of performance measurement and management tools for knowledge management in organizations have been known for many years now. Therefore, the application of similar tools in ecosystems may enable actors to have access to valuable external knowledge. However, there is a paucity of such tools in management scholarship. The purpose of this study is to bridge this gap by proposing a conceptual tool - the Ecosystem Knowledge (EK) Explorer, which generates insightful knowledge for ecosystem actors using codified technical knowledge (e.g., scientific publications and patents). Not only does the EK Explorer reduce the uncertainty and fuzziness of the knowledge exploration phase for ecosystem actors, it also enables them to save resources and have access to strategic knowledge regarding competition, collaboration, technology management, and policy making in ecosystems. Bibliometric analysis, social network analysis, and text mining were used to conceptualize the constructs and measurable variables of the EK Explorer. © 2019 Carleton University.

Evidencia de las contribuciones determinadas a nivel nacional de Brasil para la COP21]\n                    ABSTRACT: Participation in democratic regimes has been a central issue in foreign policy (FP) studies. This article seeks to contribute to the empirical discussion about FP participation through the analysis of the public consultation process conducted by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with non-state actors in the context of the preparations for the Paris Climate Agreement (2015). We employed automated text analysis using Python and R qualifying open responses submitted to the questionnaire launched at the first round of the consultations process and comparing them to the official document presented by Brazil establishing its own carbon emission targets. We found that the Brazilian academia members had a relevant influence on the content of the final document presented by Brazil, strengthening the literature on the importance of the epistemic community to environmental politics and raising new questions on the paths of foreign policy influence. © The Author(s) 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

First, she uses automated text analysis to identify climate change frames in interest groups’ press releases (N 5 1,768), coding frames for features believed to heighten cultural resonance. Then, she uses plagiarism-detection software to identify which messages were publicized in three major newspapers, 1985–2014. She finds that policy messages from structurally powerful interest groups such as business coalitions have received disproportionate media attention in the US climate debate. However, organizational resources alone are not deter-minative of messages’ success. Political messages are also more likely to receive visibility when they leverage sources of cultural power, such as by appealing to the latent worldviews of American audiences or their pragmatic concerns at particular historical moments. Results suggest both cultural and organizational power have shaped the perspectives given visibility in the American climate change debate, while also de-scribing limits on either form of power to determine media discourse. © 2023 The University of Chicago.

Although many studies extensively explored the role of corporate language policy in large corporations, employees' perceptions of such policy has not been explored adequately. Fewer studies investigate the trends in such perceptions in social media texts. This study fills this gap; it examines the barriers in multinational companies that have adopted a foreign language and analyses employees' attitudes. The study uses computer-assisted text analysis to investigate changes in employees' perceptions of an English-only policy in Rakuten, a Japanese company. It analyses a corpus of 704 social media posts on OpenWork from 2010 to 2018. The study finds some trends in employees' attitudes such as the inconsistency between expectation and reality in terms of ‘Englishnization’ and the popularity of the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC). The findings suggest that Rakuten is not global in the true sense; the value of the TOEIC score is overestimated and the neoliberal employment system affects employees in complex ways. This study contributes to international business language with a bottom-up, employee-centred, and diachronic perspective on language management. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The objectives of this study include (1) determining the important aspects of the international anime tourism experience; (2) comparing between international Eastern and Western anime tourists’ experiences; (3) understanding the sentiments behind the online reviews posted by international anime tourists. In total, 33 sub-themes and 12 themes across 3 key dimensions–cognitive, affective, and conative, were unveiled by coding undertaken by three researchers. Among Eastern and Western tourists, the aspects related to communication, expectations, service, anime authenticity seeking, and destination information were rated noticeably differently. Practitioners are urged to investigate existing ticket purchasing processes, photo policy, food options and quality, and communication, to better serve the international anime tourists. © 2022 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study developed a sentiment analysis using millions of Twitter data during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 10 metropolitan cities in Italy’s (1) north: Milan, Venice, Turin, Bologna; (2) central: Florence, Rome; (3) south: Naples, Bari; and (4) islands: Palermo, Cagliari. Questions addressed are as follows: (1) How did tweet-related sentiments change over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) How did sentiments change when lagged with policy shifts and/or specific events? Findings show an assortment of differences and connections across Twitter sentiments (fear, anger, and joy) based on policy measures and geographies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results can be used by policy makers to quantify the satisfactory level of positive/negative acceptance of decision makers and identify important topics related to COVID-19 policy measures, which can be useful for imposing geographically varying lock-downs and protective measures using historical data. © 2022 by the authors.

We gather a series of interesting facts and relationships using a variety of data mining techniques. In particular, we concentrate on attributes relevant to the user ratings of movies, such as discovering if big-budget films are more popular than their low budget counterparts, if any relationship between movies produced during the golden age (i.e. Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, etc.) can be proved, and whether any particular actors or actresses are likely to help a movie to succeed. The paper also reports on the techniques used, giving their implementation and usefulness. We have found that the IMDb is difficult to perform data mining upon, due to the format of the source data. We also found some interesting facts, such as the budget of a film is no indication of how well-rated it will be, there is a downward trend in the quality of films over time, and the director and actors/actresses involved in a film are the most important factors to its success or lack thereof. The data used in this paper is not freely distributable, but remains copyright to the Internet Movie Database inc. It is used here within the terms of their copying policy.

Classically, this involves generating completions from the LLM in response to a query before using a separate reward model to assign a score to the full completion. As an auto-regressive process, the LLM has to take many “actions” (selecting individual tokens) and only receives a single, sparse reward at the end of an episode, a setup that is known to be difficult to optimise in traditional reinforcement learning. In this work we leverage the fact that the reward model contains more information than just its scalar output, in particular, it calculates an attention map over tokens as part of the transformer architecture. We use these attention weights to redistribute the reward along the whole completion, effectively densifying the signal and highlighting the most important tokens, all without incurring extra computational cost or requiring any additional modelling. We demonstrate that, theoretically, this approach is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirically, we show that it stabilises training, accelerates the rate of learning, and, in practical cases, may lead to better local optima.

The extent of regional variation in its local government strategies, however, has been neglected. In this article, we make this enquiry through comparison of two municipalities run by the RN between 2014 and 2020. While similar in local demand and central party supply, the municipalities differ in their socio-economic context and political history. We ask if the party has responded to these contrasting contexts with different strategies of governing. We conduct a qualitative analysis of the policies introduced in both towns and draw on semi-structured interviews with government and opposition actors. In addition, we conduct a quantitative text analysis of their policy agendas, using a dictionary-based analysis to measure the extent of populist radical right ideology in each case. Our findings show that, as well as some limited regional variation in the prominence of their core ideological themes, there is a common emphasis from both on a governing style characterised by ‘pragmatism’. We argue that the prioritisation of the national party aim of mainstreaming can be a force for the nationalisation of local governing strategies from populist radical right parties, as shown here in the case of the RN. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This is the first case of COVID-19 officially confirmed in that country. Several cases have continued to increase since then. President Jokowi began issuing policies on the spread of this virus. This is different from other countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore, which responded from the previous month when the Indonesian government still stated that coronavirus does not exist in Indonesia. Our case study is to find a public opinion through social network analysis of Indonesian public policy during the beginning of the Indonesian COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. This research implements text mining and document-based sentiments on Twitter data that is reprocessed through machine learning techniques using the Naïve Bayes method. We found negative opinions in the period more dominant by 46%, while that was 35% positive sentiment and 20% neutral. This research shows that anticipation, sadness, and anger are very dominant in the emotional analysis.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study used text mining and the Policy Modeling Consistency (PMC) Index model to develop an evaluation system of Municipal Solid Waste sorting management policies that included 10 first-level variables and 51 second-level variables to quantitatively evaluate the texts of waste sorting management policies in 11 major cities, and then the PMC surface of policy texts was constructed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of individual policies according to the PMC index values. The results revealed that there were no excellent level or bad level policies among the 11 policies, with an average PMC index value of 7.71. Overall, the 11 policy texts all set out clear goals and programs in accordance with local conditions, but there are some differences across policies in terms of indicators, including policy content, policy function, policy evaluation, restriction and incentives. This study provides a fresh viewpoint on the policy evaluation of waste sorting management and offers some insight for policymakers, who should pay attention to waste separation, focus on key indicators of the policy, and enhance the effectiveness of the policy response. In addition, the applicability of the evaluation model and the difficulties associated with waste sorting governance of China in post-epidemic are discussed.

This longitudinal text-mining study investigates the relationship between topics mentioned in news articles and reader comments published the online news outlets nytimes.com (USA) and spiegel.de (Germany) from 2007 to 2020. Topics are modeled using a neural network approach based on clustered multilingual sentence embeddings. Results show that the salience of topics in news articles significantly influences their salience in reader comments but not vice versa. Metrics for agenda distance and agenda diversity confirm the media's agenda-setting role and additionally point out periods of time when events caused the media and public attention to diverge. The news media drives public opinion on organic food in the US and Germany by determining the discussion topics and is thus an important player in the promotion of organic food consumption to be considered by marketers and policy makers. © 2022\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, many of those who could have benefited from psychological or pharmacological treatments fail to be recognized or treated due to the lack of timely recognition and accurate diagnosis. Objective: This study used a topic modeling approach to explore people’s anxiety-related concerns raised on a computer-mediated Chinese health platform, YOU WEN BI DA (questioning and answering), to provide implications for accurate diagnosis, targeted education, tailored intervention, and informed policy-making in the course of addressing this condition of public concern. Methods: First, we extracted data from YOU WEN BI DA between May 2022 and February 2023. After cleaning the extracted data both using the Python text processing tool spaCy and manually, we ascertained the optimal number of topics by drawing on the coherence scores and used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to generate the most salient topics and related terms. We then categorized the topics ascertained into different classes of themes by plotting them onto a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling using the pyLDAvis visualization tool. Finally, we analyzed these topics and themes qualitatively to better understand people’s anxiety-related concerns. Results: 5 topics with different overall prevalence were ascertained through data analysis. Topic 2 (tinnitus phobia-incurred concerns, n = 639) is the most popular dominant topic, occurring in 25.1% of the 2545 collected concerns, closely followed by Topics 1 (neurosis-incurred concerns, n = 512;) and 3 (sleep, dyskinesia, bipolar, cognitive, and somatic disorders-incurred concerns, n = 619), which appeared in 20.1% and 24.3% of the 2545 concerns respectively. Topic 5 (social phobia-incurred concerns, n = 428) ranks as the fourth most popular dominant topic, showing up in 16.8% of the 2545 concerns. Topic 4 (autonomic nerve dysfunction-incurred concerns, n = 347) accounts for 13.6% of the 2545 concerns. The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding analysis reveals partial similarities between Topics 2 and 5 as well as between Topics 4 and 5 because many concerns involved in Topics 2 and 5 pertain to people’s psychological status of fear and anxiety and the relief and dispelling of such symptoms through medication, and many concerns involved in Topics 4 and 5 relate to people’s worries about the negative impact on their nerves and the adjustment and conditioning of such effects through medication. Conclusion: This was the first study that investigated Chinese people’s anxiety-related concerns raised on YOU WEN BI DA using the topic modeling technique. The automatic text analysis and complementary manual interpretation of the collected data allowed for the discovery of the dominant topics hidden in the data and the categorization of these topics into different themes to reveal the overall status of people’s anxiety-related concerns. The research findings can provide some practice implications for health and medical educators, practitioners, and policy-makers to make joint efforts to address this common public concern effectively and efficiently. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In Canada, a novel mechanism for both increasing incentives and information provision has been developed in recent decades: the mandate letter. These letters are issued by Canadian prime ministers to their ministers, reinforcing government priorities, each minister's responsibilities, and specific policy expectations. This article examines mandate letters as mechanisms inducing interministerial policy co-ordination, focusing on the 2015-2021 period, under Justin Trudeau, as the first Canadian prime minister to release these letters publicly. Using topic modelling and social network analysis, I find that Trudeau has increasingly sought to strengthen ministerial co-ordination and ministers' focus on crosscutting policy priorities. This case study contributes to our understanding of intraexecutive co-ordination and the agency problem in cabinet government.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Since emotions play a critical role in decision making according to the psychological domain of emotion science, the paramount importance of periodic delineation of stakeholders' mood is imperative for policy makers. Whereas opinion mining analytics of IoT discussions have returned state-of-the-arts, there is need to address germane factors seldom factored into existing literatures. This study therefore consolidates on current frameworks through a bi-modal descriptive and content-based analytics of IoT ecosystem for detecting key mood domain and the BlueCheckCredibility status of IoT tweeters using Profile of Mood State and Nomogram-based analytics. With a 99.5% precision rate by Logistic regression model, social characteristic attributes of acquired ethnographic data points turns mutually exclusive to the credibility status of IoT opinion molders while tweet properties contributes higher discriminative tendencies for identifying negative IoT emotions. The impact of Internet of Things on data science is likewise unraveled through bi-gram content analytics to identify topical discussions encapsulated in the acquired tweet corpus. © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Vaccination, recognized as a pivotal measure in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19, has evoked a diverse range of sentiments worldwide. In particular, numerous users on social media platforms have expressed concerns regarding vaccine availability and potential side effects. Therefore, it is imperative for governmental authorities and senior health policy strategists to gain insights into the public's perspectives on vaccine mandates in order to effectively implement their vaccination initiatives. Despite the critical importance of comprehending the underlying factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine sentiment, the existing literature offers limited research studies on this subject matter. This paper presents an innovative methodology that harnesses Twitter data to extract sentiment pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination through the utilization of Artificial Intelligence techniques such as sentiment analysis, entity detection, linear regression, and logistic regression. The proposed methodology was applied and tested on live Twitter feeds containing COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets, spanning from February 14, 2021, to April 2, 2023. Notably, this approach successfully processed tweets in 45 languages originating from over 100 countries, enabling users to select from an extensive scenario space of approximately 3.55 × 10249 possible scenarios. By selecting specific scenarios, the proposed methodology effectively identified numerous determinants contributing to vaccine sentiment across iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. In comparison to previous studies documented in the existing literature, the presented solution emerges as the most robust in detecting the fundamental drivers of vaccine sentiment and demonstrates the vaccination sentiments over a substantially longer period exceeding 24 months. © 2023 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The samples are divided into four quadrants according to the cities' economic development ability and innovation ability, forming five sample groups including full sample and four quadrants. The text mining of science and technology innovation policies in 2019 is carried out, mainly including high frequency words, semantic network graph, point degree centrality, network centrality potential, and small group analysis. The result shows that the key points of the science and technology innovation policies of national innovative cities in Chinese are prominent, which mainly rely on projects and enterprises to carry out R&D activities in order to realize the innovation of science and technology. At the same time, it's necessary to pay attention to multi-channel method to improve the innovation performance.

The objective is to investigate the development and evolution of renewable energy policies in China and to gain insights into the national-level attitudes towards renewable energy development. The study consists of two phases: initially, renewable energy policy documents undergo keyword analysis using word clouds and keyword co-occurrence network analysis to elucidate the focal areas and their interconnections within the legal and policy texts. Subsequently, after determining the optimal number of topics for modelling based on topic perplexity and consistency results, the text undergoes data cleaning to isolate words with practical significance. These words are then incorporated into the LDA topic model to analyze the distribution and content of potential topics within the policies. Lastly, by linearly segmenting the time frame, changes in topic intensity over time are visually examined using heat maps. The findings indicate that energy policies have consistently prioritized “development” and emphasized the significance of “new energy” in renewable energy policies. Moreover, as renewable energy has progressed, governments and policymakers have come to acknowledge the importance of comprehensive energy planning, transitioning to clean energy sources, and regulating the electricity market. This growing awareness has led to efforts to strengthen policy and regulatory measures to foster renewable energy's sustainable development and utilization. In summary, this study highlights the effectiveness of the LDA topic model in analyzing renewable energy policies, advancing its adoption and furthering research in the field. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

RLHF methods achieve successes in aligning LLM responses with human preferences and improving the controllability of LLM behavior with human instruction. However, RLHF methods are considerably complicated to implement, computationally expensive to train, and notoriously tricky to tune. In this work, we propose Alignment with Residual Energy-Based Model (ARM), as a simple and flexible alternative to RLHF methods. Our method is driven by an observation that we can learn an aligned policy by minimizing a forward Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence from a target policy (in the form of a residual energy-based model) to a parameteric policy (LLM), instead of a reverse KL as in RLHF methods. With samples from the energy-based target policy, we can leverage the power of DPO (or other offline methods) to learn an aligned policy efficiently. ARM is simple to implement and applicable in various data settings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate its strong performance across multiple datasets, compared to strong baselines like PPO, DPO. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In recent years, it has enabled massive breakthroughs in computer vision and natural language processing. But leveraging these advances for optimal control has proved difficult. Data is a key limiting factor. Without access to the optimal policy, value function, or demonstrations, how can we fit a policy? In this paper, we show how to automatically generate supervised learning data for a class of continuous-time nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems. In particular, applying the Feynman-Kac theorem to a linear reparameterization of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE allows us to sample the value function by simulating a stochastic process.

Although 4th IR relevant technologies may have positive impacts in many fields, they may also create harmful impacts, just as every previous industrial revolution has. Most studies dealing with the 4th IR have focused on its positive impacts; the present research concentrates on its negative impacts and suggests technological opportunities to hedge against expected risks in the future. To this end, future societal topics are first identified through latent Dirichlet allocation based topicmodeling using textual information of futuristic data,which is retrieved fromthe website, including information on future-related insights. Second, the risk topics related to the future are selected with the help of a weighting score using predefined risk keywords and sentiment analysis. Finally, safe technological opportunities are identified based on textual information derived from patent data related to risk topics with the perspectives on risk analysis that have prior (prediction, prevention) and posterior perspectives (response, recovery). To illustrate technology relevant to the 4th IR, artificial intelligence (AI) is selected. As a result, 36 topics related to future society and six future risk-related topics are suggested that reflects security-relevant properties of AI and three types of threats. Opportunities to ensure or safety through technology are also proposed in four perspectives. Technological opportunities related to safety are explored in two perspectives. One is to expand existing threats, and the other is to suggest new threats. This research can be utilized to plan future safety technology by taking a data-driven approach under the huge paradigm shift of the 4th IR and proposing potential technological solutions that are not future societal scenarios and policy solutions suggested in the previous studies. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, the representation capability of existing deep topic models is still limited by the phenomenon of “posterior collapse”, which has been widely criticized in deep generative models, resulting in the higher-level latent representations exhibiting similar or meaningless patterns. To this end, in this paper, we first develop a novel deep-coupling generative process for existing deep topic models, which incorporates skip connections into the generation of documents, enforcing strong links between the document and its multi-layer latent representations. After that, utilizing data augmentation techniques, we reformulate the deep-coupling generative process as a Markov decision process and develop a corresponding Policy Gradient (PG) based training algorithm, which can further alleviate the information reduction at higher layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our developed methods can effectively alleviate “posterior collapse” in deep topic models, contributing to providing higher-quality latent document representations. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), renowned as an international hub for tourism and entertainment, has actively responded to the crisis. However, a comprehensive analysis detailing the evolution of Macao SAR’s policies throughout this period is currently lacking. Methods: This study aims to comprehensively understand the decision-making processes, policy formulation, and implementation strategies of the Macao SAR government amidst the pandemic through the analysis of speeches and inquiries made by legislative council members and other relevant documents. Employing both quantitative and qualitative analytical methods, including word frequency analysis and word vector models, we identify key themes and patterns. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis of keyword frequencies during the two waves of the pandemic using radar charts. Results: The results indicate a heightened focus by the Macao SAR government on pandemic control measures and economic impacts. In response, the government formulated and implemented policies, provided support initiatives, and managed port clearance, all while focusing on enhancing healthcare infrastructure and community services. Conclusions: The government persistently amends its policies in response to the evolving challenges posed by the pandemic. The evolution of the dynamic Zero-COVID strategy highlights the government’s adaptability and comprehensive consideration, ensuring public health and societal stability. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

It tracks the answer to a couple of questions: Does the content of economic policy direction change every year in a more stable macroeconomic environment? If it changes, how can this be explained by theory? To investigate these changes, Korean annual economic policy direction reports released from the Ministry of the Interior were collected. Through text mining and correspondence analysis, the words in the reports over 16 years (from 2001 to 2016) were examined. The analytical results show that policy elites constantly compete to influence the policy package by putting themselves in the past to maintain and acquire legitimate authority while responding to the government's needs for creative innovation and change. © 2017 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, we propose a method to identify the urban regions and analyze their spatial-temporal features based on trajectory data mining and POIs (point of interest) semantic analysis. Through taking the correlation between vehicle running conditions and func-tions of regions into account, the characteristic points in trajectory data are clustered adaptively based on their densities. The functional areas are divided reasonably through building Voronoi diagrams based on the cluster centers. In order to effectively evaluate the compositional functions of the regions, the topic words are mined and the corresponding probabilities are calculated based on the POIs’ categories in each region, using LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. Furthermore, we propose a quantifiable method of computing the function strength based on the results of LDA. Moreover, based on the time-variant characteristics of trajectory data, an interactive visual analysis system called UFAVIS (urban functional areas visualization) is constructed to explore the impact of human activities on the spatial-temporal patterns of the functional areas. Using the method of functional area recognition with spatial-temporal feature analysis, experimental verifications and multiple case studies of the real data in Beijing are performed. The results demonstrate that UFAVIS can effectively identify the compositional functions of urban areas and find their spatial-temporal patterns changing with the variations of human activities, which provides guidance for urban planning and policy decision. © 2018, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

In this project, tweets relevant to Covid-19 Vaccine are extracted utilizing the Tweepy library. Next, tweet texts are converted into usable form in order to do sentiment analysis. After this, SentiWordNet lexicon is used to label the sentiment of the tweets. Stop words removal, Lemmatizing, stemming operations are also applied on the COVID-19 Vaccine tweets text data. Count Vectorizer and Tfidf Vectorizer are applied for mathematical conversion of the preprocessed text. Then, nine classification techniques namely - Multinomial-NB, Bernoulli-NB, Logistic-Regression, Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive-Classifier, Perceptron, Random Forest classifier, AdaBoostClassifier and Linear SVM are applied on the dataset obtained for sentiment classification and results are obtained in terms of accuracy. The best cross validation test score obtained is 0.785 with Logistic Regression Classifier and TfidfVectorizer.  © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While existing methods heavily rely on human-generated labels, it is prohibitively expensive to incorporate cross-domain experts for annotation in real-world scenarios. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new avenues for automating EA with annotations, inspired by their comprehensive capability to process semantic information. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply LLMs for EA since the annotation space in real-world KGs is large. LLMs could also generate noisy labels that may mislead the alignment. To this end, we propose a unified framework, LLM4EA, to effectively leverage LLMs for EA. Specifically, we design a novel active learning policy to significantly reduce the annotation space by prioritizing the most valuable entities based on the entire inter-KG and intra-KG structure. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised label refiner to continuously enhance label accuracy through in-depth probabilistic reasoning. We iteratively optimize the policy based on the feedback from a base EA model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of LLM4EA on four benchmark datasets in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. © 2024 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We observe that the process of extracting summarization of human can be divided into two stages: 1) a rough reading stage to look for sketched information, and 2) a subsequent careful reading stage to select key sentences to form the summary. By simulating such a two-stage process, we propose a novel approach for extractive summarization. We formulate the problem as a contextual-bandit problem and solve it with policy gradient. We adopt a convolutional neural network to encode gist of paragraphs for rough reading, and a decision making policy with an adapted termination mechanism for careful reading. Experiments on the CNN and DailyMail datasets show that our proposed method can provide high-quality summaries with varied length, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art extractive methods in terms of ROUGE metrics. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

If effectively processed, this underutilized data can provide critical insights to advance agricultural practices, decision-making, and sustainability. This work focuses on applying Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) to convert unstructured data into structured formats, addressing the challenges of domain-specific terminology and limited annotated datasets. This scarcity is primarily due to the domain-specific terminology, contextual complexity, and lack of annotated data in the agricultural domain. This study addresses these challenges by proposing sophisticated data augmentation techniques, validated using large language models and human reviewers, to enhance training data. We introduce AgNER-BERTa and AgRE-BERTa, two encoder-based models tailored for agricultural NER and RE tasks, and compare them with state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, including SciBERT, SpanBERT, and generative decoder models like ChatGPT. Our experiments demonstrate superior performance, achieving 98% accuracy for NER and 97% for RE outperforming SOTA models. The extracted entities and relations are used to construct the Agricultural Knowledge Graph (AgKG), providing structured, queryable insights to support precision agriculture, policy-making, and sustainable farming practices. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A comprehensive framework for disease management must fully connect the complete disease lifecycle, including emergence from reservoir populations, zoonotic vector transmission, and impact on human societies. The Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis is a software environment and conceptual architecture for data integration, situational awareness, visualization, prediction, and intervention assessment. Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis automatically collects biosurveillance data using natural language processing, integrates structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, applies advanced machine learning, and uses multi-modeling for analyzing disease dynamics and testing interventions in complex, heterogeneous populations. In the illustrative case studies, natural language processing from social media, news feeds, and websites was used for information extraction, biosurveillance, and situation awareness. Classification machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and boosting) were used for disease predictions. © The Author(s) 2017.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, there is a scarcity of comprehensive and up-to-date evidence to guide policymaking by monitoring climate innovation systems. This is notable, especially at the center of the innovation process, where nascent inventions transition into profitable and scalable market solutions. Here, we discuss the potential of large language models (LLMs) to monitor climate technology innovation. By analyzing large pools of unstructured text data sources, such as company reports and social media, LLMs can automate information retrieval processes and thereby improve existing monitoring in terms of cost-effectiveness, timeliness, and comprehensiveness. In this perspective, we show how LLMs can play a crucial role in informing innovation policy for the energy transition by highlighting promising use cases and prevailing challenges for research and policy. © 2023 The Author(s).

Social media platforms offer valuable insights into the depression levels of PhD students. Sentiment analysis for social media content can help identify indicators of anxiety, such as negative language, stress expressions, or mental health struggles. This paper uses social media and surveys to develop a dataset for Pakistani graduate students. The dataset collects 5096 social media posts from 1170 users, categorising them into anxiety (46.7%), depression (12.6%), and motivation (40.7%) based on mental health levels. The survey responses are combined with the social media dataset. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF), are used to detect the mental health status of PhD scholars. The study finds that 59.3% of graduate students in Pakistan face anxiety and mental health issues, indicating a need for policy reformulation in graduate programmes.

Study Setting and Design: We analyzed data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health record (EHR) between October 2015 and December 2018 using the target trial emulation framework. Veterans were included in one or more trials if they were 18 years or older, had recent evidence of housing instability, had received care in VA for at least 1 year, and had never before enrolled in SSVF. Patients who enrolled in SSVF after meeting eligibility were assigned to the treatment group, while patients who did not enroll in SSVF were assigned to a control group. We extracted patients' housing outcomes from the EHR and modeled the probability of being unstably housed each day while accounting for confounders and irregular visit times. Data Sources and Analytic Sample: We extracted housing status and covariates from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Housing instability was ascertained using a combination of structured data elements and natural language processing. Principal Findings: We identified 238,059 unique patients who met the eligibility criteria for one or more trials. The risk of housing instability decreased in both arms over the three years after initiating a trial but was lower among SSVF enrollees, with a risk difference of −12.9% (95% confidence band −14.6%, −11.2%) on Day 120 and an attenuated difference of −2.4% (−4.0%, −0.7%) on Day 1095. Conclusions: SSVF is one of the largest rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention programs in the nation. We found that SSVF improves housing outcomes over the three years following enrollment, but the effect reduces over time. These findings can inform policy and program design for improving housing outcomes for homeless-experienced individuals. © 2025 The Author(s).

To study the automation process, we consider the hierarchical ABAC model as our reference model since it better reflects the requirements of real-world organizations. Therefore, this paper focuses on the questions of: how can we automatically infer the hierarchical structure of an ABAC model given NLACPs; and, how can we extract and define the set of authorization attributes based on the resulting structure. To address these questions, we propose an approach built upon recent advancements in natural language processing and machine learning techniques. For such a solution, the lack of appropriate data often poses a bottleneck. Therefore, we decouple the primary contributions of this work into: (1) developing a practical framework to extract authorization attributes of hierarchical ABAC system from natural language artifacts, and (2) generating a set of realistic synthetic natural language access control policies (NLACPs) to evaluate the proposed framework. Our experimental results are promising as we achieved - in average - an F1-score of 0.96 when extracting attributes values of subjects, and 0.91 when extracting the values of objects’ attributes from natural language access control policies. © 2019, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Downstream countries rely on the Mekong River for fisheries, agriculture, navigation and ecological services, while upstream countries have been constructing dams to generate hydropower. The dam construction and operation in upstream countries have changed the seasonality of streamflow in downstream countries, affecting their economic benefits. More recently, cooperation between upstream and downstream countries has been enhanced throughout the river basin. In this study, we introduce a quantitative socio-hydrological model to simulate hydrological processes, reservoir operations, economic benefits, policy feedbacks and therefore dynamics of cooperation within the Lancang-Mekong River basin. The model reproduces the observed dynamics of cooperation in the basin revealed by sentiment analysis of news articles. Hydrological variability such as droughts and human activities associated with reservoir operations affect dynamics of cooperation between the riparian countries, with importance attached to indirect political benefits of upstream playing an important role in the enhancement of cooperation. In this way, our study generated understanding of emergent cooperation dynamics in this transboundary river basin, and the socio-hydrological model used here provides a useful new framework to investigate and improve transboundary water management elsewhere.  © Author(s) 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since early May 2022, Mpox has been continuously reported in several endemic countries with alarming death rates. This led to several discussions and deliberations on the Mpox virus among the general public through social media and platforms such as health forums. This study proposes natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling to unearth the general public's perspectives and sentiments on growing Mpox cases worldwide. Study design: This was a detailed qualitative study using natural language processing on the user-generated comments from social media. Methods: A detailed analysis using topic modeling and sentiment analysis on Reddit comments (n = 289,073) that were posted between June 1 and August 5, 2022, was conducted. While the topic modeling was used to infer major themes related to the health emergency and user concerns, the sentiment analysis was conducted to see how the general public responded to different aspects of the outbreak. Results: The results revealed several interesting and useful themes, such as Mpox symptoms, Mpox transmission, international travel, government interventions, and homophobia from the user-generated contents. The results further confirm that there are many stigmas and fear of the unknown nature of the Mpox virus, which is prevalent in almost all topics and themes unearthed. Conclusions: Analyzing public discourse and sentiments toward health emergencies and disease outbreaks is highly important. The insights that could be leveraged from the user-generated comments from public forums such as social media may be important for community health intervention programs and infodemiology researchers. The findings from this study effectively analyzed the public perceptions that may enable quantifying the effectiveness of measures imposed by governmental administrations. The themes unearthed may also benefit health policy researchers and decision-makers to make informed and data-driven decisions. © 2023 The Royal Society for Public Health\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Traditional fare-setting methods often focus narrowly on financial objectives, neglecting broader impacts. This study introduces a novel collaborative game-theoretic model integrating user sentiment analysis to optimize fare policies. By incorporating utilities of passengers, operators, and governments, and employing the Shapley value for fair benefit distribution, this model aims to maximize social welfare. The methodology frames fare optimization as a cooperative game among stakeholders, integrating passenger preferences through sentiment analysis. The social welfare function combines the utilities of all stakeholders and is maximized under operational, environmental, and financial constraints. Implemented in Python and applied to Isparta, Turkey, the model identifies an optimal fare of 19.5 TL (ranged between 14 and 26.50 TL) that maximizes social welfare, aligning closely with existing fares. Shapley value analysis distributes the benefits, assigning 221,457 (35.6%) units to passengers, 54,562 (8.7%) units to operators, and 347,433 (55.7%) units to the government, highlighting significant environmental gains for the government. Sensitivity analyses confirm the model’s robustness across varying trip volumes, suggesting its applicability to diverse urban settings. This research contributes to socially equitable and user-centric fare policies by providing a comprehensive framework aligning stakeholder interests. Policymakers can leverage this model to design fare strategies promoting sustainability, efficiency, and collaboration in public transportation systems. © 2024 by the author.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We offer a technically informed, but at the same time accessible, analysis of the generative AI technology behind tools such as Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, to name the most prominent LLMs currently in use. Our aim in this essay is to go beyond prior work and to provide a more nuanced reflection on the possible application of such technology for the different activities and reasoning processes that constitute theorizing within our domain of scholarly inquiry. Specifically, we highlight ways in which LLMs might augment our theorizing, but we also point out the fundamental constraints in how contemporary LLMs ‘reason’, setting considerable limits to what such tools might produce as ‘conceptual’ or ‘theoretical’ outputs. Given worrisome trade-offs in their use, we urge authors to be careful and reflexive when they use LLMs to assist (parts of) their theorizing, and to transparently disclose this use in their manuscripts. We conclude the essay with a statement of Organization Theory’s editorial policy on the use of LLMs. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To further abstract requirements and propel automation in networking, several industries have proposed the paradigm of 'network intent'. However, the translation from intents to low-level policies is considered critical to program data planes and other network elements, especially when dealing with P4-enabled switches. In this paper, we present NLP4, an architecture that helps translate intents, in the form of human language, into data-plane programs, in the form of P4 rules. In particular, NLP4 uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to translate high-level human-language intents, a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model for processing the NLP output and converting it into mid-level policy. An API then uses this information, which separates the intent from the network to generate commands readable by P4-enabled switches. Our initial prototype on a network emulator validates our architecture for a specific case: load profiling, demonstrating how even users with limited P4 expertise may customize their networks by merely specifying intents.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of thromboembolic stroke in those at higher risk; but for a number of patients, stroke is the first manifestation of undetected AF. There is a rationale for the early diagnosis of AF, before the first complication occurs, but population-based screening is not recommended. Previous prediction models have been limited by their data sources and methodologies. An accurate model that uses existing routinely collected data is needed to inform clinicians of patient-level risk of AF, inform national screening policy and highlight predictors that may be amenable to primary prevention. Methods and analysis We will investigate the application of a range of deep learning techniques, including an adapted convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and Transformer, on routinely collected primary care data to create a personalised model predicting the risk of new-onset AF over a range of time periods. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD dataset will be used for derivation, and the CPRD-AURUM dataset will be used for external geographical validation. Both comprise a sizeable representative population and are linked at patient-level to secondary care databases. The performance of the deep learning models will be compared against classic machine learning and traditional statistical predictive modelling methods. We will only use risk factors accessible in primary care and endow the model with the ability to update risk prediction as it is presented with new data, to make the model more useful in clinical practice. Ethics and dissemination Permissions for CPRD-GOLD and CPRD-AURUM datasets were obtained from CPRD (ref no: 19_076). The CPRD ethical approval committee approved the study. The results will be submitted as a research paper for publication to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at peer-reviewed conferences.

This requirement is particularly relevant in the expanding field of E-government. In this paper, we present a preliminary analysis of a public database of Digital Governance projects, based on the combination of Complex Network models and Natural Language Processing techniques. We embed projects into a complex network, in which the strength of a connection binding two projects is determined by the semantic affinity between their titles. We use an unsupervised community detection algorithm to partition the network in sets of similar projects, and interpret the results to unveil hidden information in the database. Project ratings provided by an independent evaluation group are inspected in order to investigate the strategical value of the topics underlying the communities, laying the foundation for novel quantitative methods of policy design. © 2020 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The researchers used co-citation analysis and text mining afforded by VOSviewer to document and analyze research patterns and topics reported in peer-reviewed documents published between January 2020 and August 2021. Findings of this study indicated that scholars from 103 countries or regions from the Global North and Global South investigated a wide array of topics, such as use of various technologies and strategies, redesigned curriculum, student perceptions and psychological impacts of the pandemic-imposed online learning. Many researchers applied technology acceptance theories and structural equation modeling to investigate factors associated with adoption and impacts of the pandemic-imposed online learning. Of the large quantity of research, medical education and chemical education were the most investigated disciplines. Inquiry-based learning, discovery learning, hands-on learning and collaborative learning emerged as instructional approaches frequently discussed or utilized across the target studies. This paper discussed (a) ongoing and emerging challenges to online higher education, (b) placing innovative pedagogies at the forefront of online learning, and (c) rapid, but imbalanced distribution of evolving literature based on the findings. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Online learning had attracted growing traction as a flexible and affordable means to complement traditional higher education prior to COVID-19. Higher education institutions (HEIs), faculty and students around the globe have encountered various challenges and opportunities regarding online teaching and learning during COVID-19. What this paper adds A bird's-eye-view perspective of how HEIs around the globe responded to the pandemic-imposed online teaching and learning using the bibliometric methodology. Identifications of a large body of research (n = 1061 documents) conducted by scholars from 103 countries or regions that investigated the pandemic-imposed online higher education, indicating an unprecedented level of participation in this area. An analysis of distinct themes arising from research on the pandemic-imposed online learning, such as medical education and psychological impact, chemistry curriculum and laboratory-based instruction and technology acceptance model. Implications for practice and/or policy The large corpus of studies on online higher education from different aspects can provide cross-disciplinary information guiding future research and design of online learning. With technology often conceptualized as the solution to support online learning, it is imperative to put innovative pedagogy at the forefront of the design of online teaching and learning. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Earlier studies have attempted to study this problem using self-reported emotion measurements to identify the emotions the participants felt. As an alternative, we propose the use of an emotional artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for improved modeling and prediction of the participants’ emotional behaviour to guide decision-making. We have validated the system using emotional responses to a hypothetical CCS project as a case study. Running our simulation on the experimental dataset (thus 40% of the 72,105), we obtained an average validation accuracy of 98.81%. We challenged the algorithm further with 84 test samples (unseen cases), and it predicted 75 feelings correctly when the stakeholders took a definite position on how they felt. Although there are few limitations to this study, we did find, in a sensitivity experiment, that it was challenging for the algorithm to predict indecisive feelings. The method is adaptable to study emotional responses to other projects, including Wind Energy, Nuclear Energy and Hydrogen Technology. © 2019\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN, Chen et al. [2024]). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.

International agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement are the driving framework for developing policies and fostering research and innovation. However, the proportionality of technological innovation, funding, and policy development is very skewed towards energy-intensive sectors like transport, industry and energy and ignores sectors like agriculture and waste. This paper aims to explore three dimensions that drive the development of CCMT in the agriculture sector: innovation, policy and funding. We have used a mixed-method approach where we have collected open-source data, using text mining techniques for filtering CCMT and agriculture concerning regulations and projects, and applied a descriptive analysis. The findings of this study show that there is no precise alignment of the three dimensions and confirm that only 2.3% of the EU financial contribution goes to the agriculture sector. Moreover, most of the climate change policies or regulations are intended for energy-intensive sectors and not explicitly focused on agriculture. Finally, the analysis reveals that the constricted development of CCMT in the agricultural sector is not only due to the limited financial investment but also due to conflicting policies, decisions, and regulatory cooperation. © 2020 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention. Objective: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020. Results: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide. Conclusions: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment. Such approaches have implications for policy development to improve intervention accessibility in at-risk and underserved populations. © Anne Dwyer, Abílio de Almeida Neto, Dominique Estival, Weicong Li, Christa Lam-Cassettari, Mark Antoniou.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A CASE STUDY IN INDONESIA\n                    ABSTRACT: Purpose – This study was conducted to understand the potential of cashless subsidy to reduce illegal underground economy activity in Indonesia. Research methodology – The research was done through a qualitative approach then analyzed based on the content analysis and sentiment analysis using Digital Public Services Index frim Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) research methodology as base. The data used on this study are Indonesia e-news on kompas.com, detik.com, and tempo.co from March 2021-2022 using two keywords “subsidi” (subsidy), “non-tunai” (cashless) and “nirsentuh” (contactless). Findings – The result of this study shows illegal underground economy activity can be reduced by implementing cashless subsidy policy. Research limitations – The data used on the research were big data obtained from e-news because the lack primary reliable respondent. We could not estimate the cashless subsidy after COVID-19 was ended in Indonesia because the declaration of the end of COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia was on 29 June 2023. Practical implications – This study also provides two recommendations for those problems: (a) increase digital financial literacy awareness; (b) improve the formal economy activity. Originality/Value – There still no specific research of cashless subsidy and their practice in shadow economy perspective, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia. © 2025 The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using various natural language processing techniques, we identify the main topics discussed by the Fed and major audiences. While the Fed tweets talking about central banking topics attract greater attention from Twitter users, only the extensive margin is economically meaningful. Among all groups of users, the media accounts and economists are most active in engaging with the Fed, especially when discussing central banking-related issues. We also show that information extracted from the tweets can provide a real-time, qualitative diagnostic for inflation expectations and some reaction of these Twitter-based inflation expectations to policy action and communication. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Integrating research into policy formulation not only results in more effective policies but also allows researchers to extend the reach and influence of their work to a broader and more diverse audience. In this study, we focused on one of the protected and disadvantaged groups in society, youth, whose perspectives are frequently overlooked in research studies and policymaking, even though they comprise a significant portion of the US population. We built a model that can predict whether a research article will get more citations after the first citation or not using the textual features of the research articles. Experimenting with 11 classification algorithms and analyzing the results, we identified the most important textual features and the best model to drive researchers to generate research with a higher impact on policy. We found that avoiding using complex words in research articles increases the likelihood of getting more policy citations. Moreover, semantic relevance between the research article and the policy document does not inherently guarantee increased attention from policymakers.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the plans for offshore wind energy by the shore of the state still brings much controversy between residents due to the wind farms’ impact on wildlife, coastline, and the people’s view from the beaches. In this context, we perform sentiment analysis on social media data to investigate people’s opinions and concerns regarding offshore wind energy. We adapt 3 machine learning models, i.e. TextBlob, VADER and SentiWordNet for sentiment analysis because different functions are provided by each model, all of which are useful in our work. Techniques in NLP (natural language processing) are harnessed to gather meaning from the textual data in social media. Data visualization tools are suitably deployed to display the overall results. Despite the controversy surrounding this topic, our findings indicate some positive reception, suggesting potential support for modern-day renewable energy goals. However, there are neutral and negative comments as well, thus potentially helping to find areas for further improvement. The results of this work can be thus useful in a variety of decision-making contexts by governmental organizations and companies, hence aiding and enhancing offshore wind energy policy development. Hence, this work is much in line with citizen science and smart governance via involvement of mass opinion in decision support. In our paper, we highlight the role of sentiment analysis from social media in this aspect. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

By examining the discourse and frequency of terms connected to opioids, this study introduces a novel text mining tool to examine the role of the dark web in the opioid epidemic. Leveraging advanced data crawling techniques, this study encompasses the collection of a rich dataset from the dark web, revealing a predominance of discussions around opioids such as Oxycodone, Morphine, and Fentanyl. The results of our analysis show that Oxycodone is the most often referenced opioid, indicating that it is in high demand in the illegal drug trade. Furthermore, the surprising mention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) with opioids suggests a complicated terrain of self-medicating behaviors among users. This paper is notable for its methodological innovation, which uses text mining to provide insights into the dark web’s impact on the opioid crisis. The findings not only add to our comprehension of illicit opioid trade dynamics, but also provide vital information for public health policies and policy design targeted at reducing the opioid epidemic.

Nonetheless, the relationship between public health and populism extends before and beyond the pandemic. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of existing evidence and theoretical conceptualisations on the intersection of populism, health emergencies, and contrarian scientific positions, drawing from a diverse range of disciplines. I conducted a scoping review of 283 original studies, analysing their analytical framework, geographic focuses, and methodological approaches. Employing quantitative text analysis, I summarised the research field into 18 common topics, organised into five coherent categories: citizen's perspective, political elites, political communication, pandemic consequences, and non-COVID-related issues. While the scholarly interest in this area has surged since the onset of the pandemic, it has predominantly concentrated on specific cases, such as Brazil and the US, often conflating different policy types. The evidence summary elucidates that populism assumes varying roles within distinct contexts, and there is no linear relationship between political populism and specific approaches to health crises and science. I further compare definitions of populism within the context of health and scientific positions. I propose that future research should employ a policy typology for health emergency responses, assessing political positions based on policy arenas. This paper contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay between political populism, contrarian scientific perspectives, and public health. © 2024 The Author\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The role of social media is vital to this emerging trend. Traditionally, lack of public participation in various policy making decision used to be a major cause of concern particularly when formulating and evaluating such policies. However, the exponential rise in usage of social media platforms by general public has given the government a wider insight to overcome this long pending dilemma. Cloud-based e-governance is currently being realized due to IT infrastructure availability along with mindset changes of government advisors towards realizing the various policies in a best possible manner. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that combines the capabilities of both cloud computing and social media analytics towards efficient monitoring and controlling of governmental policies through public involvement. The proposed system has provided us some encouraging results, when tested for Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation by Indian government and established that it can be successfully implemented for efficient policy making and implementation. © 2019, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The aim of the present paper is to give an overview of research topics in early childhood education research based on the analysis of 39,926 scientific articles published between 2000 and 2021 and to explore research trends over time. Therefore, a structural topic modelling approach was used. The analyses show a strong increase in publication activity over the last years as well as the diversity of research topics, which provide important insights for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals in various areas (cultural diversity, design of inclusive learning environments, educational institutions, professional development issues, educational policy and reforms, etc.). Beside topics like cultural diversity, and inclusive learning environments more specific research topics, for example self-regulation, executive functions, numeracy, language development and physical activity have been increasingly addressed in publications over the years. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, safety and security risks of SHs hinder their wide adoption. Many work attempts to provide defense mechanisms to ensure safety and security against interrule vulnerabilities and spoofing attacks. This article proposes IoTFuzz, a fuzzing framework that dynamically address cyber security and physical safety aspects of SHs through targeted policies. IoTFuzz mutates the inputs from policies, human activities, indoor environment, and real-life outdoor weather conditions. In addition to the binary status of devices, the continuous-value status in SHs is leveraged to perform mutation and simulation. The policies are expressed as temporal logic formulas with time constraints. For large-scale testing, IoTFuzz employs digital twins to simulate normal behaviors, outdoor environment impacts, and human activities in SHs. Moreover, IoTFuzz can also intelligently infer rule-policy correlation based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The evaluation of IoTFuzz in a configured SH with 15 rules and 10 predefined unique policies demonstrates its effectiveness in revealing the impacts of real-life outdoor environment. The experimental results demonstrate a range of violations, with a maximum of 4154 violations and a minimum of 41 violations observed over an 8-year period under varying weather conditions. IoTFuzz also identifies the potential risks associated with improper human activities, accounting for up to 35.4% of risky situations in SHs.  © 2014 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Anti-establishment rhetoric before and after government participation\n                    ABSTRACT: Scholars argued that anti-establishment parties use a populist rhetoric that appeals to the worst instincts of people. Indeed, populist politicians are often viewed as charismatic leaders that have fire in their belly. While in the past these parties heavily relied on anti-establishment platforms and communication rhetoric, their increasing electoral success along with the growing duties linked with government membership transform them into more established parties, rather than pure outsiders, and cast doubts on the feasibility of keeping a populist rhetoric. This paper compares right-wing and non-right-wing populism, investigating whether populist leaders change their rhetorical strategy once in office, decreasing the level of negativity and adopting a more forward-looking and inclusive style of communication, with a stronger focus on fulfilling the policy proposal made during the electoral campaign rather than blaming political rivals. For this purpose, we collected a new corpus of political speeches extracted from video messages posted on Facebook by four anti-establishment party leaders in three countries (Austria, Italy and Spain), from 2016 to 2018, i.e., immediately before and immediately after their access to power. Overall, 30 h of recorded audio from 215 videos (amounting to around 140 million visualizations) have been analyzed using topic models and well-established semantic psycholinguistic dictionaries. The results highlight slight changes in the rhetoric of populist leaders once in power, mostly for non-right-wing populists, as their language becomes less negative, less assertive and more focused on government duties. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The concerns range from concrete and tangible ones—which include replication of existing biases and discrimination at scale, harvesting personal data, and spreading misinformation—to more existential fears that their development will lead to machines with human-like cognitive abilities. Understanding how chatbots work and the human labor and data involved can better help evaluate the validity of concerns surrounding these systems, which although innovative, are hardly the stuff of science fiction. © 2023 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Research Findings/Insights: We find a positive (negative) and statistically significant relationship between board size (board independence) and IPO underpricing at the time firms go public. But more importantly, when interacting with corporate governance variables at the firm level, uncertainty in tone still shows statistical significance, which suggests that tone in communications matters for underpricing independently of governance provisions at the firm level. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Bigger boards seem to lead to greater underpricing, whereas more independent boards mitigate it. This finding stresses the relevance of functional convergence in regions with weak institutions such as Latin America. Our results also suggest that tone matters for underpricing even in firms with good governance practices. We argue that tone in corporate communications is a strong signaling mechanism for market participants. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that tone in firms' communications is relevant for market valuation. In the context of family firms in an underresearched context such as Latin America, we show that reputation effect is priced by the market valuation of the IPO. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Yet little attention has been paid to the origins of regulatory discretion, and how it varies across polities, policy areas, and over time. This paper presents a conceptualization of regulatory discretion that draws on three dimensions: delegation, content, and procedure. It argues that to measure regulatory discretion in legislation, we need to identify provisions that delegate regulatory powers to governments and then examine the extent to which exercising regulatory powers is constrained. Using Natural Language Processing techniques, this paper presents descriptive findings of the dynamics of regulatory discretion in the United Kingdom between 1900 and 2020. The findings portray how discretion has been constrained and formalized over the years through the content of regulations, while it has still retained high levels of flexibility in exercising regulatory powers. In doing so, the findings illustrate the rise of the British regulatory state through its legislative language. © 2023 The Author.

Despite of police organizations being a rich source of qualitative data (present in less formally structured formats, such as the text logs), little work has been done in automating steps to allow this data to feed into intelligence-led policing tasks, such as demand analysis/prediction. This paper examines the use of police incident logs to better estimate the demand of officers across all incidents, with particular respect to the cases where mental-ill health played a primary part. Persons suffering from mental-ill health are significantly more likely to come into contact with the police, but statistics relating to how much actual police time is spent dealing with this type of incident are highly variable and often subjective. We present a novel deep learning based text mining approach, which allows accurate extraction of mental-ill health related incidents from police incident logs. The data gained from these automated analyses can enable both strategic and operational planning within police forces, allowing policy makers to develop long term strategies to tackle this issue, and to better plan for day-today demand on services. The proposed model has demonstrated the cross-validated classification accuracy of 89.5% on the real dataset. © 2019 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we develop and examine a research model hypothesising the underlying content-related factors contributing to the diffusion of misinformation. The study is tested by a dataset comprising 144K Twitter posts extracted from the United Kingdom from February 2020 to January 2022. We found that the frequency of three content topics (i.e., face protection, international economic support, and screening methods) is negatively associated with the diffusion of misinformation, whereas content similarity is not. Our analysis illustrates different influences of various trending topics on misinformation propagation in the setting of uncertainty management. Accordingly, policymakers, especially in times of crisis, should emphasize more information on preventive behaviours and provide factual messages that can improve public trust, reducing the possibility of misinformation spreading. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

One possible heuristic is to conceptualize discourse as a network of actors and policy beliefs. Here, we present an exemplary and widely applicable automated approach to extract discourse networks from large volumes of media data, as a bipartite graph of organizations and beliefs connected by stance edges. Our approach leverages various natural language processing techniques, alongside qualitative content analysis. We combine named entity recognition, named entity linking, supervised text classification informed by close reading, and a novel stance detection procedure based on large language models. We demonstrate our approach in an empirical application tracing urban sustainable transport discourse networks in the Swiss urban area of ZÜrich over 12 years, based on more than one million paragraphs extracted from slightly less than two million newspaper articles. We test the internal validity of our approach. Based on evaluations against manually automated data, we find support for what we call the window validity hypothesis of automated discourse network data gathering. The internal validity of automated discourse network data gathering increases if inferences are combined over sliding time windows. Our results show that when leveraging data redundancy and stance inertia through windowed aggregation, automated methods can recover basic structure and higher-level structurally descriptive metrics of discourse networks well. Our results also demonstrate the necessity of creating high-quality test sets and close reading and that efforts invested in automation should be carefully considered.  © The Author(s), 2025.

The case at hand, Germany, is a prime example of a welfare state that was particularly resistant to reform. Hence, the rapid paradigm shift in German family policy since the late 1990s is puzzling. This study seeks to resolve this puzzle by drawing on the insight that public discourse is crucial for policy change. Politicians have to promote reforms prior to their implementation. The main channel for communication with the wider public is the mass media. I use newspaper coverage from 1990 to 2016 to analyze whether the media is responsive to reform initiatives. I use topic modeling, an innovative method from the computational social sciences (CSS), to identify dominant themes and shifts over time in a large corpus of newspaper articles (N = 1,459). The analysis shows that public discourse was responsive to the parliamentary debate. The article also clarifies the role of critical events and identifies discursive strategies. © 2019 The Authors.

To capture this paradigm, this study surveyed telemedicine literature, including postpandemic publications, to identify dominant research themes and temporal trends and suggest directions for future research. Methods: A corpus of 56,445 telemedicine studies is sourced from PubMed. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling performed using the Konstanz Information Miner platform. The textual data for topic modeling were processed by following standard procedures for natural language processing. Moreover, the term frequency-inverse document frequency approach was used to capture the importance of words within the corpus. We assessed perplexity, coherence, and the elbow method to determine the optimal number of topics for modeling. Results: The findings confirm the surge in telemedicine research after 2020, signifying its prominence. LDA topic modeling reveals seven distinct research themes, with the most prominent topic being “patient satisfaction” (21.38%) followed by “perspectives and challenges” (17.95%), and “smartphone apps” (14.32%). Furthermore, the results demonstrate a noticeable shift in topics from screening to therapeutic applications of telemedicine. Conclusions: This study serves as a guide for a broad range of telemedicine research topics. This synthesis of themes reflects the commitment of scholars to address the changing dynamics and health care needs, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, aging in place, smartphone usage, and technological advancement. The analysis also reveals flexible research responses to policy and contextual shifts, highlighting the collective drive to broaden the application of telemedicine in community health care. © Aeri Kim et al., 2024; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Several studies showed that deep learning models using these architectures not only possess remarkable linguistic knowledge, but they also exhibit forms of factual knowledge, common sense, and even programming skills. However, the scientific community still debates about their reasoning capabilities, which have been recently tested in the context of automated AI planning; the literature presents mixed results, and the prevailing view is that current transformer-based models may not be adequate for planning. In this paper, we address this challenge differently. We introduce a GPT-based model customised for planning (PLANGPT) to learn a general policy for classical planning by training the model from scratch with a dataset of solved planning instances. Once PLANGPT has been trained for a domain, it can be used to generate a solution plan for an input problem instance in that domain. Our training procedure exploits automated planning knowledge to enhance the performance of the trained model. We build and evaluate our GPT model with several planning domains, and we compare its performance w.r.t. other recent deep learning techniques for generalised planning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Not only arriving at this policy, but theIndonesian government also implemented a follow-up policy, namely the obligation to show a vaccine certificate as a requirement for domestic travel. The policy came into effect and was implemented in 2021. The policy reaped pro and con opinions or responses from all Indonesian people. For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the sentiment of public opinion related to the implementation of the policy to achieve the goal of knowing the level of dominance of opinions and obtaining evaluation material for the Indonesian government regarding the implementation of the policy as well as the foundation material for the implementation of future policies. The collection of public opinion data was taken from digital news related to the topic COVID-19 vaccine certificates as a requirement for domestic travelsourced from Youtube with the acquisition of raw data, which was 1500. This sentiment analysis uses the Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm with steps, namely, data collection by scraping using Google Collab tools, text preprocessing, TF-IDF weighting, and Naïve Bayes classification in two ways, namely using Google Collab tools and using the system that has been built. The results of this study were that the accuracy values of the NBC algorithm were 73%, 75.7% (Google Colab), and 90.67% (System) with negative dominant public opinion sentiment value.  © 2024 Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The analysis is done in an empirical and quantitative way. The picture of certain topics in the news is measured by the sentiment in the media in the UK and Germany. This study measures the sentiment with the help of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural network that analyses sentiment in publicly available news streams in the UK and Germany. The results show that online media indeed transports different pictures for some popular topics and some neighboring countries in Europe if there is low media coverage. An equally interesting finding is that there is, in general, a broad consensus between the sentiments in British and German media if media coverage is high. In addition to the differences in media reporting between the UK and Germany, this study shows that low media coverage also tends to reflect badly on the business indicators of a target variable/topic. Both findings show that low media coverage tends to transport inaccurate information. These findings show again how important the fake news and post-truth debate is. Social media users in a filter bubble are not only confronted with filtered and biased news. In addition, news coverage in general narrows and the filter bubble problems get amplified. Businesses, news providers, social media networks, political actors, and policymakers can consider the information provided to analyze the source of information gaps and the impact on their operations and policies. © The Authors, 2019.

Social media posts convey not only plain text, but also sentiments and emotions that provide insight into the experiences of the autism community. While sentiment analysis categorizes overall sentiment, emotion analysis provides nuanced insights into specific emotional states. The objective of this study is to identify emotions in posts related to autism and compare the emotions specifically contained in posts that include the hashtag #ActuallyAutistic with those that do not. Methods: We extracted a sample of X' posts related to autism and used DistilBERT to assign one out of six emotions (sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, surprise) to each post. Results: We have analyzed a total of 414,287 posts, 98,602 (23.8%) of those included the hashtag #ActuallyAutistic. The most common expressed emotion was joy, which was expressed in 52.5% of the posts, followed by sadness, identified in 28.6% of the posts. 12% of the posts expressed fear, 4.9% reflected anger, 1.1% showed love, and 0.9% expressed surprise. Posts tagged as #ActuallyAutistic showed less joy (27.1% vs. 60.4% in posts without this hashtag, p<0.001) and more sadness (52.7% vs. 21.1% in those without the hashtag, p<0.001). Conclusions: The use of the hashtag #ActuallyAutistic is associated with a different emotional tone, characterized by less joy and more sadness. These results suggest the need for greater support and acceptance towards the autistic community, both online and in society in general. Insights from our study can be valuable for policy makers, health, educational or other programmes aiming at enhancing well-being, inclusiveness, improve services, and create a more compassionate and understanding atmosphere for autistic people. © 2024 The Authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An immersive learning experience, in which learners participate in simulated virtual environments, can promote deep learning as learners actively explore and construct knowledge within the learning environments. Despite the growing interest and increasing applications, the ways in which machine learning can be used to augment the design and assessment of immersive learning experience remain an open area of exploration. Machine learning can be used to provide adaptive and personal-ized learning, increase interactivity and engagement, and track learning activities in immersive learning environments. In this chapter, the author describes the current state of research on machine learning in immersive learning environments, including adaptive and personalized learning, natural language processing and conversational artificial intelligence, and data and learning analytics. The author also outlines the potential future directions for the applications of machine learning in designing and assessing immersive learning experiences to inform educational sciences. This chapter serves as a useful reference for educational researchers, practitioners, and policy makers seeking to make informed decisions on the design and assessment of immersive learning experiences. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The object to be assembled is of industrial nature: for the application, it consists in a car engine oil pump. The following devices are used to the realization of the assembly: - A commercially available robot (ERICC with 5 d.o.f rotation and filled with DC actuators); it is relatively inexpensive, with medium-rating performance (0,5 mm of repeatability); - An image processing system, including a CCD 580x500 pixels video camera plus an image processor board for the acquisition and processing of the images; GO-NO-GO tactil sensors implemented on the robot as well as in the assembly area, intended to monitor the operations; Two conveyor belts carrying parts to be assembled; -Three PC-AT like microcomputers for the control of these equipments; - One commercially available expert system (NEXPERT OBJECT) with which the user has to build the knowledge base. Thanks to the realization and integration of the following: - Learning softwares for the creation of a whole set of data necessary during the assembly process: robot trajectories, objects models; - One image processing module based on fast image segmentation and description algorithms, allowing the recognition of the objects; - One control and monitoring module which will build and execute a sequence of ordered actions from a general manufacturing plan, to provide the final product. The implemented module is a Production Rule System, whose knowledge base contains the list of actions to be carried out, depending on the state of the assembly cell. If the sensors detect a random behaviour, a set of specific rules is activated in order to generate, if possible, a new action sequence to allow the manucfacturing process to continue) - An assembly platform which makes use of passive compliance. Among the advantages of this technique based on medium accuracy robot/specific image processing system/passive compliance assembly platform/expert system: - The investment is sufficient to carry out the industrial assembly of medium size units (measured in cm) with clearances of tenths of a millimetter; - Staff training: the firm's toolist specialists can build the assembly platform in just a few weeks. Since the image learning software and creation trajectory software have an user friendly man-machine interface only a few days are required to master theirs operations. Since the knowledge expression is performed in a syntax close to the natural language, someone who has smattering of artificial intelligence will be able to build the knowledge base; - The flexibility of the unit, thanks to the expert system and the image processing system; - The assembly speed should be considered within the firm's automation policy.

This paper argues that we must expand this view and consider generative AI not merely as a vehicle for producing traditional content at scale, but as enabling an entirely new form of media that is adaptive and interactive in real-time and can be personalized for individual users. Referred to herein as Interactive Generative Media (IGM), this new form of targeted influence could be used to manipulate individual users at scale and compromise human agency. Two specific tactics are presented: Targeted Generative Advertising and Targeted Conversational Influence. The risks of each are described along with recommended policy protections. © 2023 IMSCI.

Methods: All municipal governments in Japan in existence as of October 1, 2008 (n = 1,809) were sent a self-administrated postal questionnaire; 1,027 (56.8%) responded. Answers to the open-ended question were analysed using IBM SPSS Text Analytics for Surveys 4.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: Only about one-quarter of 1,027 municipalities (n - 242; 23.6%) offered support measures to provide or arrange opportunities for older residents with dementia to enhance various motivating factors in their lives. The most common measure was adult day services, which were not for providing formal care services covered by Japan's Long Term Care (LTC) insurance but for offering social and leisure activities (n = 95; 39.3%). Conclusion: None of the support measures found in this study were distinctive or exclusively for older people with dementia, but were rather common services for older people implemented widely in Japan. Further studies are required to find out the causes of differences in basic policy regarding social inclusion of older people with dementia among municipal governments in Japan. © 2014 Japan Health Sciences University & Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Methods: Analyzing 105,727 posts from Naver news comments, blogs, internet cafés, and Twitter between 2010 and 2022, this study deployed a Python script for data collection and preprocessing. STM analysis was con-ducted using R, with the documents’ publication years serving as metadata to trace the evolution of discussions on patient safety. Re-sults: The analysis identified a total of 13 distinct topics, organized into three primary communities: (1) “Demand for systemic improvement of medical accidents,” underscoring the need for legal and regulatory reform to enhance accountability; (2) “Efforts of the government and organizations for safety management,” highlighting proactive risk mitigation strategies; and (3) “Medical accidents exposed in the media,” reflecting widespread concerns over medical negligence and its repercussions. These findings indicate pervasive concerns regarding medical accountability and transparency among healthcare consumers. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of transparent healthcare policies and practices that openly address patient safety incidents. There is clear advocacy for policy reforms aimed at increasing the accountability and transparency of healthcare providers. Moreover, this study highlights the significance of edu-cational and engagement initiatives involving healthcare consumers in fostering a culture of patient safety.

However, manually collecting policy-related evidence is a time-consuming and tedious process, making some automated collection methods necessary. This paper presents a novel approach for automating policy evidence collection through large language models (LLMs) combined with Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) prompting. The advantages of our approach lie in its minimal data requirements, while ReAct prompting enables the LLM to call external tools, such as search engines, ensuring real-time evidence collection. Since this is a novel problem without existing methods for comparison, we relied on human experts for ground truth and baseline comparison. In 50 experiments, our method successfully collected correct policy evidence 36 times using GPT-3.5. Furthermore, with more advanced models such as GPT-4o, the improved understanding of prompts and context enhances our method’s efficiency. Finally, our method using GPT-4o successfully gathered correct evidence 45 times in 50 experiments. Our results demonstrate that, using our method, policy researchers can effectively gather evidence to support policy-making. © 2025 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this complex context, new agricultural policies are being implemented in Europe. Their success depends on their potential to adapt to new realities, responding to the opinions and demands of the European population. Given the rapid rise of social media as an important part of people's daily lives, public administrations have introduced digitalization and communication strategies through social media sites. Social media can provide policymakers with large amounts of data on user opinions. Given the value of social media as a rich source of data on public views and opinions, the aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to use natural language processing (NLP) to identify the events that have led to negative or positive opinion about European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform and (ii) to evaluate the ability of NLP to study users' opinions on Twitter/X. The findings show that issues such as Brexit, the European Green Deal, the role of CAP in the environment, livestock farming, food safety, and illegal practices and corruption in the distribution of CAP funds have crucial implications for the design and application of the new CAP. Moreover, the study also suggests that NLP techniques can provide opportunities to integrate agricultural policies and instruments in the agri-food sector by assessing society's opinions. Sentiment analysis, even considering its limitations, could support sound and inclusive policymaking approaches anticipating public opinion in cases of risk of social unrest. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Most current methods employ the encoder–decoder framework to achieve satisfactory results. Recently, transformers have been extensively utilized in image captioning tasks and earned satisfactory results. Nevertheless, transformers pay more attention to the global features in images and divide images into fixed sizes and process them separately. Those models can not capture the relationship between the internal components in image, such as the relationships between objects, regions and object attributes. In this article, we introduce a novel Residual Swin Transformer and Actor-Critic (RSTAC) in the image captioning task. RSTAC consists of two modules: Residual Swin Transformer and Actor-Critic modules. In particular, we employ a residual network to preserve the vanilla feature in the first place and several residual Swin Transformer blocks with convolution operations to obtain the mid-level features, which are also composed of a residual network and several Swin Transformer blocks and convolution operations. It aims to explore the internal correlation between image content and obtain multi-view features in the image. Then, a policy network is utilized to explore possible words and forecast the future generation word. A value network is employed to calculate the reward of generated sentences whose goal is directly optimizing non-differentiable quality metrics and enhancing the performance of generated sentences. Experiments reveal that our model surpasses other competitive models and performs better on the MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2022.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study presents a deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) clustering algorithm integrated with a multinomial logit model to extract and analyze individual activity-trip patterns from the 2017–2018 Regional Travel Survey (RTS) data from the Washington metropolitan area. Transforming daily activities of travelers into 288 five-minute intervals, the data was prepared as text and then fed into the NLP model, combined with a k-means clustering algorithm. This method identifies six distinct acitivity pattern clusters, encompassing full-time and part-time workers, retirees, students, and self-employed individuals. The model succeeds in recognizing distinct activity pattern clusters that were then interpreted looking at the relationships between activities, patterns, and socio-economic characteristics. It leverages the multinomial logit model to analyze the probability of cluster membership based on socio-economic factors, enriching the understanding of activity patterns across different demographic groups. This approach offers a nuanced perspective on urban populations' travel behaviors, facilitating targeted and equitable urban planning and policy-making. The study demonstrates the model's capability in handling complex activity sequence datasets, consisting of temporal activity sequences. This research underscores the value of integrating deep learning models in urban studies, opening new avenues for sophisticated, data-driven urban planning. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The evaluation time of a PDP (Policy Decision Point) grows significantly when the PDP loads a large-scale policy set coded in XACML. In order to improve the PDP evaluation performance, we propose an optimized policy evaluation engine, namely XDLEngine, and make the following contributions. First, XDLEngine has an advantage in the process of handling a large-scale policy set, and innovatively adopts the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model to cluster policies. Second, according to the clustering results of the LDA model, we digitize and vectorize all rules in policy sets, which facilitates the rule matching. Third, the cosine similarity is introduced to classify the rules under each topic, which greatly reduces the number of comparisons in the process of rule matching and improves the matching efficiency of XDLEngine. Finally, due to the independence between different topics, we use a multi-threaded parallel search in the process of rule matching, which significantly lowers the evaluation time of XDLEngine. The experimental results show that when the number of requests reaches 20,000, the evaluation time of XDLEngine for a practical large-scale policy set with 120,000 rules is approximately 2.48%, 3.47% and 3.68% of that of the Sun PDP, XEngine and HPEngine, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Most LLM deployments occur within cloud data centers, where they encounter substantial response delays and incur high costs, thereby impacting the Quality of Services (QoS) at the network edge. Leveraging vector database caching to store LLM request results at the edge can substantially mitigate response delays and cost associated with similar requests, which has been overlooked by previous research. Addressing these gaps, this paper introduces a novel Vector database-assisted cloud-Edge collaborative LLM QoS Optimization (VELO) framework. Firstly, we propose the VELO framework, which ingeniously employs vector database to cache the results of some LLM requests at the edge to reduce the response time of subsequent similar requests. Diverging from direct optimization of the LLM, our VELO framework does not necessitate altering the internal structure of LLM and is broadly applicable to diverse LLMs. Subsequently, building upon the VELO framework, we formulate the QoS optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and devise an algorithm grounded in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to decide whether to request the LLM in the cloud or directly return the results from the vector database at the edge. Moreover, to enhance request feature extraction and expedite training, we refine the policy network of MARL and integrate expert demonstrations. Finally, we implement the proposed algorithm within a real edge system.

However, they are still suffering from low accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose to strengthen the existing approach by enhancing a language agent, which provides automatic explanation of terms and repair of tactics parameters. Term explanation explains terms specific to the proof obligations formally and tactic parameter repair complements the potentially correct proof tactics as much as possible. Similar to the existing approach, the agent uses GPT-4 as query objects in a search policy. During the search, we add term explanation to the prompt, and then the policy selects a proof tactic and repairs it. The repaired tactics interact with the theorem prover (Coq), and the execution result is fed back to build the prompt for the next policy invocation. We evaluate our approach on subsets of the CompCert project implemented using Coq. Our approach proves 8.11% more theorems than the existing language agent COPRA, and demonstrates faster search and proof speed. Besides, when term explanation and tactic parameter repair are applied, the performance of the SOTA method PROVERBOT9001 can be also improved. © 2024 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, I analyze Wealth of Nations and A Theory of Moral Sentiments-analysis which refutes environmentalists' claims that Smith's self-interest is the motivating factor of capitalist accumulation in our economy. In order for a change in ethics and broader policy that may encourage sustainable land practices within our present economic and agricultural system, I hypothesize that we must also include Aldo Leopold's land ethic to strengthen the claim that Smith's notion of sympathy can be stretched to change the way humans interact with and perceive nature. Using the works and critique of Smith and Leopold as foundations, this paper re-theorizes the present day ethical human. Amidst a tumultuous landscape, I argue a change in ethics is required to institute on a large scale, sustainable practices that can mitigate environmental degradation and put us in harmony with fellow humans and nature. To ground my research, I also rework Carol Rose's customary claims as a possible legal mechanism to work with the new ethical human. Lastly, I contribute particular strategies for current social movements, so they may recognize the new ethical self in others and other things, not as divided from the land, but part of it. © Common Ground Publishing, Charles S.

The conference was supported by generous funding from the University of Toronto Press and from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The contributions to this special issue of the UTLJ are based on articles originally presented at the conference. Some of the speakers discussed the kinds of tasks that machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) can perform, when used to conduct legal research, to identify biases and discrepancies at the doctrinal level and in the performance of lawyers and judges, and to facilitate access to justice for those who cannot readily afford legal services. Other speakers considered the challenges that algorithms based on ML and NLP pose to democratic conceptions of legal authority. Taken together, the articles offered a range of views on the prospects and perils of AI for the practice of law and for the legal system as a whole. This introduction briefly describes the contributions, moving roughly from the more theoretical to the more concrete aspects of these issues. © 2018 University Of Toronto Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Though it is well recognized that emergence of new fields is complex and uncertain, to make decisions amidst such uncertainty, one needs to mobilize various sources of intelligence to identify known–knowns and known–unknowns to be able to choose appropriate strategies and policies. This competitive technical intelligence cannot rely on simple trend analyses because breakthrough technologies have little past to inform such trends, and positing the directions of evolution is challenging. Neither do qualitative tools, embracing the complexities, provide all the solutions, since transparent and repeatable techniques need to be employed to create best practices and evaluate the intelligence that comes from such exercises. In this paper, we present a hybrid roadmapping technique that draws on a number of approaches and integrates them into a multi-level approach (individual activities, industry evolutions and broader global changes) that can be applied to breakthrough technologies. We describe this approach in deeper detail through a case study on dye-sensitized solar cells. Our contribution to this special issue is to showcase the technique as part of a family of approaches that are emerging around the world to inform strategy and policy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study introduces an AI-driven framework combining BERTopic, semantic similarity analysis, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to evaluate alignment between 106,661 English-language academic papers and 618 national-level policy documents. Topic modeling reveals strong convergence in themes such as “Coal mining and geological formations,” which account for 15.73 % of academic publications, while “Safety regulations and worker protection” dominate policy texts at 13.35 %. In contrast, emerging topics like “Digital economy and carbon transformation” remain underrepresented, with a popularity score of only 0.13. Semantic similarity analysis across 22 policy and 27 academic topics yields an average cosine similarity of 0.23, with only 12.5 % of topic pairs exceeding 0.4, underscoring thematic misalignment. Structurally, policy networks are 15.9 times denser and exhibit 30 × higher clustering coefficients than scientific networks, indicating more centralized but less diversified discourse. DRL-based prioritization identifies “Power systems and renewable integration” as the top-performing theme (Q-value = 1.6225), highlighting opportunities for targeted energy transition policies. These quantitative results offer empirical evidence to guide theme-based policy adaptation and foster actionable science-policy integration. © 2025 The Author\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using emotion analysis on data gathered from a social media platform, experiments are developed to bring new value to architectural and civic narratives. Emotions from texts collected within social media platforms are extracted and mapped alongside tagged locations to gain a greater understanding of how public spaces are utilized. This project develops a new analytical layer within our built environment, working alongside the urban fabric, mechanical systems, and digital infrastructure. It is offered as an interactive tool for policymakers and designers to glean feedback, creating an informed conversation between citizens and decision-makers. Whereas social media platforms such as Twitter and Yelp have been referenced in past academic contexts, this project moves further by producing quantified emotions, painting a differentiated result from what purely semantic data could deliver. © 2020, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

While debates rage among policymakers, practitioners, and politicians about regulating AI's widespread use, it's undeniable that AI represents a long-awaited digital technology poised to revolutionize organizational performance. Amidst the post-COVID era, the allure of AI has intensified, yet the critical question lingers: Can firms effectively harness AI and other technologies, such as Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), to enhance their existing systems? Through a systematic literature review, a clear correlation between firms’ implementation of AI, including the cutting-edge Generative AI, and their ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, drive operational excellence, and unlock new avenues for growth are explored. Moreover, key drivers of AI and digital adoption, such as the imperative for data-driven decision-making, the quest for customer-centricity, and the drive for sustainable business practices are explored. Our research not only highlights the transformative potential of AI and digital technologies but also provides actionable insights for business leaders navigating the complexities of technology adoption. By understanding the motivations, challenges, and strategic imperatives driving firms' technology choices, including the integration of Generative AI and LLMs, organizations can chart a path towards sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the digital age. This study underscores the revolutionary impact of Generative AI in digital transformation, offering a comprehensive understanding of their role in shaping the future of business. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Policymakers have a need to understand the dynamics of public discussion in real time. Human values, which are cognitively related to attitudes and serve as reference points in moral argument, are important indicators of what's at stake in a public controversy. This work shows that it is possible to link values data with reader behavior to infer values implicit in a topical corpus, and that it is possible to automate this process using machine learning. Thus, this work represents a preliminary attempt at scalable computational social science using techniques from natural language processing. © 2011 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A Big Data Analytics Study of China\n                    ABSTRACT: The transition from combustion vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is critical for mitigating climate change. As the global leader in the EV market, China has been propelled by government policies, market dynamics, and public awareness. As sentiment is fundamental to human communication, however, existing research lacks a systematic examination of the extent to which public environmental affect influences EV adoption at the macro level, particularly in the presence of government interventions and market strategies. To address this gap, we construct a novel affect index using a CNN deep learning model to extract environmental affect (positive, negative, and neutral) from Weibo posts between 2014 and 2023. Employing monthly EV market share as the dependent variable, we incorporate affect indices as key independent variables, alongside control variables such as government subsidy reductions, price levels, and other marketing strategies. A time-series cointegration model is applied to assess the long-term impact of environmental affect on EV sales. Empirical results reveal that only positive environmental affect has a significant and positive impact on EV adoption, whereas key industry factors, including subsidies, charger availability, patent activity, and price disparities, also play crucial roles. These findings highlight the growing influence of public awareness in shaping the EV market transition from government-driven to market-driven growth. Our study reconciles conflicting findings in prior research and provides actionable insights for policymakers and marketers seeking to foster sustainable EV adoption. © 2025 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Based on trends in the growth of LLMs/data centers and symmetry/favorability of SMR techno-regulatory environments, scenario analysis yielded nine potential future scenarios. This analysis finds three sets of insights: First, SMRs offer the most promise in the “Era of Radical Innovation” scenario, where they could emerge as a key clean power supply for data centers via distributed generation systems. Second, three key factors will determine the success of SMR implementation: optimizing regulatory framework, achieving technological maturity and enhancing social acceptance. Third, adverse SMR scenario triggers the need for alternative strategies, such as renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency enhancement. It pinpointed major challenges to address: decoupling licensing processes, gaining economic competitiveness via modular fabrication and stakeholder acceptance. Against this background, the study offers a three-tiered set of policy recommendations: one for immediate action (including regulatory reforms and R&D support); another focused on medium-term infrastructure development and workforce training; and a third targeted on long-term international cooperation frameworks. A systematic evaluation of their potential to meet the rising power demands for AI while providing energy security and environmental sustainability is presented in this research. © 2024 Korean Nuclear Society\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, implementing such reports entails a challenge, such as the comprehension of a large number of textual information from various sources. This task can be accelerated by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and ontologies to effectively model the domain knowledge. In this study, we extended an existing ontology to model ESRS Topical Standard for disclosure. The developed ontology would enable automated reasoning over the data and assist in constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Moreover, the proposed ontology extension would also help to identify gaps in companies’ sustainability reports with regard to the ESRS requirements. Additionally, we extracted knowledge from corporate sustainability reports via LLMs guided with a proposed ontology and developed their KG representation. ©2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Due to population growth and high urbanization rates, cities must enhance the quality and efficiency of services and resources provided, while at the same time supporting sustainable and long-term economic growth. However, few cities worldwide are actually becoming truly “smart,” most of them being in the early stages of implementation. This chapter aims to provide how artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning natural language processing and robotics can serve to overcome the main smart cities challenges (budgetary constraints, one-size-fits-all approach, digital skills and curriculum reforms, security and privacy problems, pollution, traffic congestion, citizens’ inclusion, governance, and regulatory framework represent important challenges facing smart cities development). © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

NLM's director, Donald A.B. Lindberg M.D., and staff sought to identify new program possibilities benefitting from the input of current and potential users of the Library's information services. Conference recommendations led to a key NLM policy change providing cost-free access to all AIDS data, and the establishment of the HIV/AIDS Community Information Outreach Program (ACIOP), which enabled new partnerships with local community-based organizations serving the affected community. Uniquely funded and long running, more than 300 ACIOP projects have been supported to-date. These projects have improved awareness and use of national HIV/AIDS information resources; enhanced information seeking skills; developed locally generated information resources; and enhanced the capacity of community-based organizations to use new information and computer technologies providing access to essential information resources and services.  © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, existing systems engage with users in a reactive manner, relying on a basic single-query mechanism with the knowledge base and employing passive policy planning. The proactive TOD systems, which can provide potentially helpful information and plan cross-domain multi-task dialogue policies, have not been well studied. In addition, effective evaluation methods are also lacking. To address these issues, we propose ProTOD, a novel LLM-based proactive TOD framework designed to improve system proactivity and goal completion. First, we design an adaptive exploratory retrieval mechanism to dynamically navigate domain knowledge. Second, we introduce a two-stage passive-to-proactive policy planner that effectively organizes knowledge and actions relationship. Finally, we develop two distinct user simulators with different personalities to simulate real-world interactions and propose a new error measure called Human-targeted Policy Edit Rate (HPER) for evaluation. Experimental results show that ProTOD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, improving goal completion rates by 10% while significantly enhancing the proactive engagement. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This logic gained a stronghold in policymaking, but its implementation nevertheless struggled to find acceptance. Public university tuition is one such case where policymakers aimed to increase investment in human capital through cost sharing. While students in some countries accept them as a necessary evil, opposition arises in others. Students in Germany and Turkey took to the streets in support of tuition-free higher education. Despite differences in their political contexts and the differential mediating role political culture plays, student mobilization reversed right-wing parties’ policies. This article focuses on how opposition to tuition policies is covered by the news in both countries. Using a mixed-methods approach combining topic modeling with qualitative analysis, I show that student protests and tuition policy discussions are reported separately. In both countries, student protests involving confrontation were highlighted whereas reports on institutional actors dominated policy discussions. However, when movements pressure political parties to “own” an issue in their platform, party endorsement subsequently amplifies issue salience even if movement organizations and parties are not covered together by the media. This indicates an indirect effect of movements’ collective action on news coverage. Political party endorsements mediate the amount of coverage movement issues receive. This finding provides insights into how opposition to welfare state retrenchment might navigate difficulties in closed media cultures that heavily favor institutional actors. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study provides a descriptive account of uncivil interactions between citizens and politicians on Twitter. We develop a conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of incivility at three distinct levels: macro (temporal), meso (contextual), and micro (individual). Using longitudinal data from the Twitter communication mentioning Members of Congress in the United States across a time span of over a year and relying on supervised machine learning methods and topic models, we offer new insights about the prevalence and dynamics of incivility toward legislators. We find that uncivil tweets represent consistently around 18% of all tweets mentioning legislators, but with spikes that correspond to controversial policy debates and political events. Although we find evidence of coordinated attacks, our analysis reveals that the use of uncivil language is common to a large number of users. © The Author(s) 2020.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Patent citation analysis is easy to use, but fundamentally has two main limitations: (1) new patents tend to be less cited than old ones and may miss citations to contemporary patents; (2) citation-based analysis cannot be used for patents in databases which do not require citations. Naturally, citation-based analysis tends to underestimate the importance of new patents and may not work in rapidly-evolving industries in which technology life-cycles are shortening and new inventions are increasingly patented world-wide. As a remedy, this paper proposes a patent network based on semantic patent analysis using subject-action-object (SAO) structures. SAO structures represent the explicit relationships among components used in a patent, and are considered to represent key concepts of the patent or the expertise of the inventor. Based on the internal similarities between patents, the patent network provides the up-to-date status of a given technology. Furthermore, this paper suggests new indices to identify the technological importance of patents, the characteristics of patent clusters, and the technological capabilities of competitors. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to synthesis of carbon nanotubes. We expect that the proposed procedure and analysis will be incorporated into technology planning processes to assist experts such as researchers and R&D policy makers in rapidly-evolving industries. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Reviews of this policy domain mostly either refer to general issues without deep immersion into details or focus on specific narrower aspects. The paper uses semantic analysis to identify major themes of science, technology and innovation policies over the last three decades and to trace their evolution towards current policy setting. We use semantic tools for processing and analysing documents produced by one of the major and highly reputable international expert bodies, the OECD Working Party on Technology and Innovation Policy. We show that selected themes remain in the mainstream even though being affected by regular policy adjustments and refinements and which disappear or appear with new challenges and expected solutions. Other themes appear niche or exotic themes which are under discussion for some time only. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to ascertain the inclination and the reasons for vaccine hesitancy by conducting content analysis and sentiment analysis of the perspectives expressed in comments on videos related to vaccine hesitancy uploaded from India on YouTube. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment of the sentiments of the vaccine-hesitant population is done using Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis module implemented with Python’s NLTK library to automatically determine the sentiments of the comments. Manual content analysis was performed on 60.09% viewer comments randomly selected from the total comments in 238 videos on vaccine hesitancy originated from India and labelled each comment with labels “Anti”, “Pro”, “Confused”, “Not Applicable” and “Unrelated” labels. Findings: The study found “Mistrust-Government policies”, “Fear-health related consequences”, “Mistrust-Scientific research”, “Vaccine effectiveness and efficacy” and “Misinformation/myths” as the top five determinants for vaccine hesitancy, whereas “Religious beliefs”, “Fear-Economic consequences”, “Side Effects- short-term” and “Fear-mode of administration” found to be the lesser cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. However, the study also investigates changes in the inclination of Indian commenters towards vaccine hesitancy and revolving issues over time. Social implications: Public health policymakers and health communicators may find the study useful in determining vaccine hesitancy factors in India. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its approach. To date, no sentiment analysis has been conducted on the content released on YouTube by Indian content creators regarding pro- and anti-vaccination videos. This inquiry seeks to fill this research gap. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Traditionally, incorporating information into EBP is time-consuming and dependent on human expertise. However, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies presents an opportunity to revolutionise the collection, analysis, and utilisation of evidence in policymaking. Despite the rapid advancements in AI algorithms, their roles and functions in EBP, particularly in science and technology (S&T), have not been systematically explored. This research aims to examine the functions of AI in S&T EBP, employing an interdisciplinary approach and a non-normative perspective. The study is conducted in two phases. The first phase utilises a comprehensive literature review to identify and conceptualise the components of AI-enabled EBP, including the technological aspects of AI and its policy functions. In the second phase, the constant comparative method (CCM) is employed to categorise and establish relationships between the identified components. This research identifies seven main AI technologies including natural language processing, speech recognition, image recognition and processing, affect detection, autonomous agents, data mining, and artificial creativity, which have 30 policy functions. The proposed framework of this research shows the relationships among AI-enabled EBP steps, AI technologies, and their policy functions. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The benefits of computerised text analysis come from the ability to analyse, for the first time, complex and daunting electronic sources of text, such as the parliamentary record. This allows the systematic estimation of the policy positions of individual political actors, with huge benefits both for theory development and empirical analysis. In this article, the technique is used to analyse all 58 English language speeches made in the October 1991 confidence debate on the future of the incumbent Fianna Fáil-PD coalition. The task was to use the words spoken in the debate to locate every one of the individual speakers on a 'pro- versus anti-government' dimension. The purpose was, first, to examine the validity of computerised text analysis when applied to legislative speeches and, second, to answer substantively interesting questions about the positions of individual Irish legislators in 1991. The results vindicate the use of computerised analysis in the context of legislative speeches and locate all speakers in the 1991 debate in a substantively interesting policy space. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This was a stark contrast to the steep falls in most types of recorded crime. Why was ASB so different? Was it changes in ‘traditional’ ASB such as noisy neighbours, or was it ASB records of breaches of COVID-19 regulations? Further, why did police-recorded ASB find much larger early-pandemic increases than the Telephone Crime Survey for England and Wales? This study uses two approaches to address the issues. The first is a survey of police forces, via Freedom of Information requests, to determine whether COVID-regulation breaches were recorded as ASB. The second is natural language processing (NLP) used to interrogate the text details of police ASB records. We find police recording practice varied greatly between areas. We conclude that the early-pandemic increases in recorded ASB were primarily due to breaches of COVID regulations but around half of these also involved traditional forms of ASB. We also suggest that the study offers proof of concept that NLP may have significant general potential to exploit untapped police text records in ways that inform policing and crime policy. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (eg, GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models. Practitioner notes What is currently known about this topic Generating and analysing text-based content are time-consuming and laborious tasks. Large language models are capable of efficiently analysing an unprecedented amount of textual content and completing complex natural language processing and generation tasks. Large language models have been increasingly used to develop educational technologies that aim to automate the generation and analysis of textual content, such as automated question generation and essay scoring. What this paper adds A comprehensive list of different educational tasks that could potentially benefit from LLMs-based innovations through automation. A structured assessment of the practicality and ethicality of existing LLMs-based innovations from seven important aspects using established frameworks. Three recommendations that could potentially support future studies to develop LLMs-based innovations that are practical and ethical to implement in authentic educational contexts. Implications for practice and/or policy Updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models may further reduce the amount of manual effort required for adapting existing models to different educational tasks. The reporting standards of empirical research that aims to develop educational technologies using large language models need to be improved. Adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process could contribute to resolving the practical and ethical challenges of large language models in education. © 2023 The Authors.

It examines how media organisations shape narratives through strategic framing. Employing the Natural Language Processing technique – Topic Modelling – with a generative probabilistic model LDA and a transformer-based language model BERT, the study reveals generic frames elaborated by more specific extensions, shedding light on media portrayal of economy, public opinion, security & defence, external regulations, policy evaluation, and health & safety sectors. Through Named Entity Recognition with roBERTa, Sentiment Analysis with distilBERT, and Corpus Linguistics methods with LancsBox X, interpretation of these overarching frames provides a comprehensive analysis of the nuances in narratives, societal perceptions and policy decisions amidst the ongoing war. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We present an application of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model: to classify an unstructured text into semantically coherent sectors. The main advantage of the recommended methodology is that along with the sector limitations, it produces the topic distribution associated with each sector. We express an alternate methodology that converts message posting data into a text representation and uses topic modelling to identify outlines through the data set. The data were collected from 1,391,549 comments posted in 15 Facebook fan pages between June 2019 and January 2020. We establish that the behaviour possibility of using social media has become progressively relation term; education and entertainment have come to be more significant. By quantifying the sequential movements of topics at the generation level, we found that Thai youth in diverse areas tend to focus on altered sub-domain, while closely generation normally share educational topics. Our discoveries could be of excessive value to academics and policy makers who are interested in classifying encouraging or popular topics. The results demonstrate topic modelling as a beneficial implement for mining significant data from realistic Thai youth social media using behaviours. © 2020 SERSC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recently, promising results have been attained by Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods through trial and error in simulators, bringing confidence in solving cities' congestion problems. However, performance gaps still exist when simulator-trained policies are deployed to the real world. This issue is mainly introduced by the system dynamic difference between the training simulators and the real-world environments. In this work, we leverage the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and profile the system dynamics by a prompt-based grounded action transformation to bridge the performance gap. Specifically, this paper exploits the pre-trained LLM's inference ability to understand how traffic dynamics change with weather conditions, traffic states, and road types. Being aware of the changes, the policies' action is taken and grounded based on realistic dynamics, thus helping the agent learn a more realistic policy. We conduct experiments on four different scenarios to show the effectiveness of the proposed PromptGAT's ability to mitigate the performance gap of reinforcement learning from simulation to reality (sim-to-real).

By using multilingual quantitative text analysis, I show that the electoral salience of minimum wages has increased in the past decades. Although left-wing parties emphasize minimum wages more than right-wing parties, I find that the electoral salience of this policy follows a U-shaped relationship: right-wing populist parties dedicate greater attention to minimum wages than centre-right parties do. A sentiment analysis finds that compared to other policies designed to supplement the income of low-wage workers, such as strengthening collective bargaining institutions and in-work benefits/wage subsidies, there do not seem to be specific party-political characteristics, which determine the sentiment with which discussions on minimum wages are framed. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We investigate the impacts of China’s rural human settlement environment policy on rural pollution, focusing on regional variations in policy implementation by provincial governments. Utilizing text-mining methods to compare the policy documents issued by both central and provincial governments, we constructed an indicator termed ‘policy content heterogeneity’ to quantify heterogeneous local implementation behaviors. Based on the panel data from the 2014 and 2016 waves of the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), we used Differences-in-Differences models to analyze the changes in rural human settlement environment among 4,174 rural households across 165 rural communities. Our study found that air, water, and noise pollution have been significantly mitigated among provinces implementing policies with a higher degree of policy content heterogeneity. This study advocates for consideration of regional diversity when formulating and enforcing national policies by constructing policy content heterogeneity as a novel dimension in evaluating local government behavior and underscores the need for continuous research and monitoring of local policy implementation processes. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We go to the roots of changes of fiscal policy in Germany and use a novel data set on all parliamentary speeches in the Bundestag from 1960 to 2021. We propose an embedding-based approach, which allows the representation of words and documents in a shared vector space, in order to measure fiscal policy-related sentiment in parliamentary debates at a scale from contractionary to expansionary. We also distinguish between sentiment related to exogenous and endogenous fiscal policy. We put fiscal sentiment into a series of recursively-identified vector autoregressive models to show that a change in fiscal sentiment causes a shift in government spending and has significant effects on the macroeconomy. The results support the notion that the debate in parliament contains information for the identification of government spending shocks. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The state of government data against political corruption\n                    ABSTRACT: Government data about its own action is a core element of a modern democratic state. Much of this data may help spot conflicts of interest or other instances of compromised decision-making and corruption. Using data from the Global Data Barometer in 67 Open Government Partnership (OGP) member countries, the authors analyze the current gaps in countries data availability across eight policy areas related to political corruption and open government: asset disclosure, political finance, company beneficial ownership, land ownership and tenure, public procurement, lobbying, right to information, and rulemaking. The results show countries still face a range of significant challenges in opening anti-corruption data. In most cases, government datasets are not available as open data and do not include the most useful information, which limits their utility for public oversight. When high-quality datasets are made available to the public, data science applications - including natural language processing and anomaly detection - have proven effective for the detection and prevention of corruption. To maximize benefit from these increasingly popular data approaches, governments must ensure that datasets are open and supported with strong human oversight mechanisms to create a more direct link between transparency and accountability. © The Editor and Contributing Authors Severally 2025.

The study is undertaken to bridge the gap. It introduces the hybrid model for predicting online public opinion about political parties in Pakistan. The model analyzes user emotions and behavior, encompassing anger, fear, joy, anticipation, healthcare and education policies. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a communication framework to examine the interplay between social media dynamics and Pakistan’s political landscape. The proposed hybrid model combines supervised machine learning and deep learning for Twitter-based text classification to assess political perceptions. A total of 52,067 tweets were analyzed and categorized into eight emotion groups. Findings: The study reveals a significant increase in public engagement with social and political discussions on social media. Politicians increasingly leverage social media platforms as tools for communication and propaganda, influencing democratic norms. The proposed hybrid model effectively classified political sentiments and demonstrated high accuracy in analyzing public perceptions of political parties in Pakistan. Practical implications: This research proposes a cost-effective communication framework to enhance public engagement. Political communication offers a methodological baseline for policymakers to understand public opinion and design their communication strategies using prediction models. Originality/value: The study introduces a hybrid approach to evaluate political sentiments by analyzing user emotions and behavior. The comparison of healthcare and education policies adds depth to the analysis and provides valuable information for voters. This research extends agenda-setting theory in the digital era by providing robust and accurate forecasting of policymakers’ agendas which were previously limited. Using machine and deep learning, this research reveals that agenda setting is a reciprocal and dynamic process and is shaped by the digital interplay between media, policymakers and public response. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The econometric analyses show that optimistic tax policy statements stimulate consumption, investment, and output, even after controlling for tax foresight. We also find that consumer sentiment reacts positively to more optimistic tax news, suggesting that sentiment plays an important role in the transmission from U.S. presidential tax policy communication to economic activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

When equipped with access to functions and memory, they can be transformed into interactive and intelligent LLM agents. However, the applicability of such LLM agents in real-time Internet of things (IoT) applications remains constrained by resource limitations. One critical area is IoT security, particularly in intrusion detection systems (IDS), where LLM agents hold the potential to enhance the effectiveness of existing solutions significantly. Current IDS approaches in IoT, predominantly reliant on signature-based or anomaly-based techniques, struggle to adapt to the dynamic and evolving nature of modern threats. Recent studies reveal a prevalence of false positives in existing IDS, complicating the alert reasoning and decision-making process. To address these limitations, this research proposes a novel adaptive IDS policy orchestration framework that leverages LLM agents in conjunction with advanced prompting strategies. Our framework generates adaptive IDS policies, enhancing precision with intelligent alert reasoning. It enables efficient policy deployment without needing LLM inference during policy execution. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments conducted on five real-world IDS datasets. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves over 97% precision on three IoT network datasets and over 80% on two more challenging datasets. Notably, our framework reduces the detection latency by 50% compared to traditional machine learning (ML) models with the requirement of fewer than 10k total completion tokens, offering a highly cost-effective, efficient, and scalable solution. These findings establish a new benchmark for IoT-IDS frameworks utilising LLM agents, underscoring the potential for further advancements in this domain. © 1986-2012 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It is crucial to have specialized expertise and advanced technologies to tackle such challenges. However, the field has unexplored domains, and available solutions are not holistically charted, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the innovation landscape and growth trajectories. This study aims to undertake a patent analysis on mountain transportation and logistics to unveil emerging trends, map technological advancements, and contribute to enhancing transportation systems. Relevant patent documents were extracted from the Derwent Innovation Index database through a keyword search combined with specific International Patent Classification categories. From these documents, technological fields were identified and grouped using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation technique, resulting in 12 clusters. Among them, seat and suspension control systems, intelligent vehicle control systems, electrical systems and electric vehicles, bicycle frame design, and safety devices are likely to attract notable interest in the future. The findings contribute to the academic discourse and hold practical implications for industry and policy stakeholders, offering a nuanced understanding of technological trends crucial for addressing transportation challenges in mountain terrains. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

No policy mining algorithm can produce completely accurate policies, necessitating human intervention to correct errors before implementation. However, humans may fail to revise the produced policies without fully understanding all permission details. In this paper, we propose an on-the-fly framework to assist human revisions by mining usable policies. This framework is formulated as an approximate optimization problem, designed to avoid permission errors and redundancy by balancing submodularity and modular costs through an iterative search for access rules. The search space is guided by two pruning techniques: a tight optimistic estimate to only eliminate unpromising candidates and a queue cutter to sample promising candidates in advance. Experimental evaluations on two real-world and three publicly available synthetic datasets indicate that: 1) our method produces more concise results than existing methods, achieving a 93.2% reduction in redundancy; 2) our method is at least five times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. To further validate the usability of the policies obtained by our approach, we conducted a user study involving 30 participants and 7 large language models (LLMs). The results show that 90.9% of participants, including LLMs such as gpt-4o-mini, successfully modified our mined policies to meet given permission goals. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Along with the sharing videos, YouTube creates a social networking platform by allowing sharing of feelings, views, and opinions about a video called vlog. It also allows uploading of videos of all ages (child, young and old people). YouTube has its policy for defining age-restricted content on YouTube. But a lot of uploaded videos are not marked as age restricted though they actually contain pornographic contents. YouTube has a team for reviewing the video content upon receiving a report from the user only. All the existing methods identify the pornographic video based on the visual or audio-visual features of video. However, there is no automatic method exist the author aware of identifying them based on vlogger sentiment. Thus, the challenge of automatically detecting this kind of video content is significant in applications like content filtering, detection of illegal content, etc. In this paper, we present an automatic method for identifying the pornographic content on YouTube based on the vlog stream. The experiment has been executed on both the age-restricted vlog stream and non-restricted vlog stream to validate the proposed method. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with nearly 80% accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These systems assist users to accomplish certain tasks efficiently. However, most commercial TOD systems rely on handcrafted rules and offer functionalities in a single domain. These systems perform well but are not scalable to adapt multiple domains without manual efforts. Pretrained language models (PLMs) have been popularly applied to enhance these systems via fine-tuning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in this field but lack the ability to converse proactively in multiple turns, which is an essential parameter for designing TOD systems. To address these challenges, this paper initially studies the impact of language understanding on the overall performance of a TOD system in a multi-domain environment. Furthermore, to design an efficient TOD system, we propose a unified approach by leveraging LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) based dialogue policy. The experimental results demonstrate that a unified approach using LLM is more promising for scaling the capabilities of TOD systems with prompt adaptive instructions with more user friendly and human-like response generation. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

While existing research conducted policy evaluation from the lens of performance assessment, less study has been devoted to evaluating energy supply policy from the perspective of policy making. This study takes the energy supply policy documents issued by China's central government during the ‘13th Five-Year Plan’ period (2016–2020) as the research sample, and pioneers the use of the extended policy modelling consistency (PMC) index model combined with the text mining methodology to construct a policy evaluation index system with the characteristics of the energy supply policy which conducts a more in-depth quantitative evaluation of the energy supply policy documents. The results show that the average PMC index value of China's energy supply policies is 7.26, and the overall quality is high. The concerns of existing policies are mainly focused on reform and development planning, safety production management and project engineering construction, but there is still room for improvement in policy predictability, coordination of policy areas, clarity of policy basis and goals and comprehensiveness of policy tool combinations. Based on this, China should improve the comprehensiveness of its energy supply policy tool combinations in terms of policy design norm; strengthen policy predictability and coordination of policy areas in terms of policy implementation guarantee; and clarify the basis and goals of policies in terms of policy orientation enhancement, to provide a reference basis for the formulation and improvement of future energy supply policies and to realise the sustainable development of energy supply. © 2023 The Authors.

My analysis reveals that borrowers (especially with non-performing loans) did not actively seek out mortgage forbearance (conditional on communication) in response to this policy, which was intended to prevent a pandemic-induced foreclosure. This is an outcome of the servicer's differential treatment between government and private loans, as the CARES Act was designed for government loans only and left scope for servicer discretion for private loans. These results bring into question the effectiveness of ad hoc laws and the implementation thereof during the COVID-19 pandemic.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM’s inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Methods: After collecting artificial intelligence-and nursing-related news articles published between January 1, 1991, and July 24, 2022, keywords were extracted via preprocessing. A total of 3,267 articles were searched, and 2,996 were used for the final analysis. Text network analysis and topic modeling were performed using NetMiner 4.4. Results: As a result of analyzing the frequency of appearance, the keywords used most frequently were education, medical robot, telecom, dementia, and the older adults living alone. Keyword network analysis revealed the following results: a density of 0.002, an average degree of 8.79, and an average distance of 2.43; the central keywords identified were ’education,’ ‘medical robot,’ and ‘fourth industry.’ Five topics were derived from news articles related to artificial intelligence and nursing: ‘Artificial intelligence nursing research and development in the health and medical field,’ ‘Education using artificial intelligence for children and youth care,’ ‘Nursing robot for older adults care,’ ‘Community care policy and artificial intelligence,’ and ‘Smart care technology in an aging society.’ Conclusion: The use of artificial intelligence may be helpful among the local community, older adult, children, and adolescents. In particular, health management using artificial intelligence is indispensable now that we are facing a super-aging society. In the future, studies on nursing intervention and development of nursing programs using artificial intelligence should be conducted. © 2023, Korean Society of Nursing Science.

In the healthcare domain, patient narratives, through various mediums, have emerged as a valuable source of insight into the experiences of patients and the healthcare system. Recognizing the value of such textual data, diverse analytical methods have been developed, spanning from text mining to narrative analysis. This article presents experiments that combine computational methods, qualitative methods and citizen science for analyzing patients’ stories. In this article, we reflect on two experiments in which we combined these approaches, which we analyze through a generative lens. We distinguish three main effects of the experiments: they provide a platform for discussions as a 'site of controversy'; they act as 'mediator', fostering new connections and mutual understanding among participants; and they serve as 'tin opener', stimulating substantive discussions about methodological development and substantive healthcare matters. Narrative reduction, which occurs when rich narrative data is simplified into structured quantifiable forms, is not inherently problematic; instead, it can be meaningful when combined with qualitative methods and citizen science, emphasizing the importance of utilizing diverse methods to balance authenticity and gaining broader insights. The study highlights the significance of collaborative sense-making and meaning-making in interdisciplinary research. Engaging patients, their relatives, and professionals in the analytical process, facilitated by tools like word clouds, promotes engaged discussions that yield actionable insights. Further development of such interdisciplinary approaches holds promise for a more nuanced understanding of patient experiences, fostering epistemological pluralism, and refining healthcare practices. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Government started exploiting the high capabilities and popularity of the social media much later, so there has been much less research concerning their effective utilization by government agencies. This paper contributes to filling this research gap, presenting a novel framework for the effective utilization of the Web 2.0 social media by government agencies for promoting participative governance and applying crowdsourcing ideas. It is based on the centralised automated publishing of content and micro-applications to multiple Web 2.0 social media, and then collection of citizens’ interactions (e.g. comments, ratings) with them, based on central platform that uses efficiently the application programming interfaces (APIs) of these social media. Finally, citizens’ interactions are processed in this central platform using a variety of techniques (web analytics, opinion mining, simulation modelling) in order to provide finally useful analytics that offer substantial support to government decision and policy makers. Furthermore, an application and an evaluation model for the proposed framework are described, as well as an extension of it that combines active/moderated and passive/non-moderated crowdsourcing. © 2013 European and Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems.

This study aims to map the evolution and interdisciplinarity of drought research over time and across regions, offering insights for decision-makers, researchers, and funding agencies. By analysing more than 130 000 peer-reviewed articles indexed in SCOPUS from 1901 to 2022 using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for topic modelling, we identified distinct shifts in research priorities and emerging trends. The results reveal that plant genetic research for drought-tolerant genotypes and advancements in drought forecasting are the most dominant and continuously growing areas of focus. In contrast, the relative importance of topics such as ecology, water resource management, and forest research has decreased. Geospatial patterns highlight a universal focus on forecasting methods, with a strong secondary emphasis on policy and societal issues in Africa and Oceania. Interdisciplinarity in drought research experienced a marked decline until 1983, followed by a steady increase from 2007 onward, suggesting a growing integration of diverse fields. Emerging topics in recent years signal evolving priorities for future research. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of drought research trends across sectors and regions, offering strategic guidance for aligning research efforts with drought resilience goals. The findings are crucial for research funding agencies and policymakers aiming to prioritize areas with the highest potential to mitigate drought impacts effectively. © 2025 Copernicus Publications.

The policy changes led to mixing responses from the public, namely netizens. Netizen shares their opinion in social media, including Twitter. Their opinion can represent the public’s trust in the Government. Sentiment analysis analyses others’ opinions and categorises them into positive opinions, negative opinions, or neutral opinions. Sentiment analysis can analyze large numbers of opinions so that public opinion can be analyzed quickly. This paper explains how to analyze public trust using sentiment analysis and to use Naïve Bayes classification method to analyze sentiment. The data research was taken from Twitter in the first quarter of the Covid-19 pandemic, with around 3000 tweets. The tweets were related to Covid-19 and the Government from several countries such as the United States, Australia, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Canada, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, and Lebanon. This study aims to determine the level of public trust in the Government in the first quarter of the Covid-19 pandemic. The research result is expected to be used as a reference for the public policy stakeholders to determine future policies. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to identify the core characteristics of Saemaul Undong, which was applied as a strategy for rural development in Korea, to analyse the role of government in the implementation process of this policy, and to put forward some implications for the developing countries to be able to apply its principles and the government’s roles for their own rural development. Design/Methodology/Approach. The methods applied to the analysis are text mining analysis and topic modelling analysis, which are widely used in the field of social sciences nowadays. The data em-ployed in this study are the guidelines regarding implementing the Saemaul Undong policy, which was drawn up by former president Park Chung Hee. Results/Discussion. As a result of the analysis, it may be said that the core characteristics of Saemaul Undong policy include: emphasis on the role of Saemaul Undong leaders, financial support from the Government, cooperation of villagers, support from public officials, a spirit of self-help, and movement to promote rural development. Conclusions. In conclusion, it is expected that the principles and implementation methods of the Saemaul Undong policy implemented in Korea in the 1970s can be applied to developing countries suffering from poverty in the future if they are appropriately modified to suit the conditions of developing countries. Originality. So far, the important principles of Saemaul Undong’s policy have not been studied through topic modeling, so fundamental principles have not been derived. This study has great significance be-cause it systematically derived core principles through the topic modeling method. © 2024 The author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The research method included a combination of literature review and text mining. The study found that research on cultured meat in developing countries has focused on consumer attitudes and acceptance, cultural factors, and policy and regulation. Consumer purchase intentions, attitudes, and knowledge levels significantly impact the promotion and adoption of cultured meat. At the same time, cultural factors, religious regulations, and sustainability challenges are also important factors affecting the development of cultured meat in developing countries. Furthermore, developing and implementing policy and regulatory frameworks are critical to fostering the development of sustainable meat systems. Through the combination of literature review and text analysis, this study provides an in-depth look at research on cultured meat in developing countries over the past decade. The findings suggest that consumer attitudes, cultural factors, and sustainability challenges are central topics in cultured meat research in developing countries. However, relatively little research has been done on social acceptance, economic feasibility, and technology adoption. These findings provide important insights for policymakers, researchers, and relevant stakeholders in formulating policies and strategies to advance sustainable food systems. © 2023 The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Despite robust evidence supporting male HPV vaccination, China has yet to approve it. Public discussions on male HPV vaccination, influenced by policy delays, gender norms, and commercialization, reveal diverse attitudes and significant challenges in achieving equitable health outcomes. This study investigates public perceptions and attitudes toward male HPV vaccination in China by analyzing cognitive frames and the social, cultural, and economic factors shaping these discussions. Methods: This study employs a cross-sectional design to analyze 4997 Sina Weibo posts using the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN), identifying five frames: Disease Risk and Prevention, Virus Transmission, Gender Roles and Perceptions, Vaccine Promotion and Acceptance, and Market Dynamics and Consumption. Results: The findings reveal a significant gap between policy implementation and public awareness of male HPV vaccination in China. Despite growing recognition of its benefits, entrenched gender norms and biases hinder equitable health outcomes. Social media, as a pivotal platform for health communication, plays a dual role in facilitating public discourse while also amplifying misinformation. Policy delays and concerns over vaccine commercialization heighten public hesitancy, emphasizing the need for inclusive policies and targeted education. Conclusions: This study highlights the necessity for systemic efforts to address gender biases, enhance public education on male HPV vaccination, and rebuild trust in vaccination programs. A multifaceted approach is required to bridge these gaps, integrating policy reforms, inclusive health communication strategies, and equitable vaccine access. These measures aim to promote awareness and increase vaccination uptake among males in China, ultimately contributing to more comprehensive and equitable public health outcomes. © 2025 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since citizens who have beneficial awareness or knowledge are not always experts on relevant social issues, assessing and sharing public concerns are needed to reduce barriers to public participation. We propose two approaches to assess public concerns. The first is building a linked open data set by extracting public goals for a specific social issue aimed at by citizens or agents from articles or public opinions. This paper deals with hierarchical goals and subgoals for recovery and revitalization from the Great East Japan Earthquake manually extracted from related articles. The data set can be used for developing services to match citizens and agents who aim at similar goals to facilitate collaboration. The second approach is building a linked data set by extracting assessment criteria for a specific social issue from public opinions. This paper deals with candidate terms that potentially represent such criteria for a specific public project automatically extracted from clusters of citizens' opinions. The data set can be used as evidence for policy-making about the target project. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A captivating epoch in CR has emerged, and it defies conventional interpretation. We ask how to extract the frontier research topics from patents, which countries are driving innovation in CR, and what policies are contributing to the current situation. This paper uses patent analysis and text mining to study 1831 C R-related patents and finds four clusters from the Derwent Innovations (DI) database. The patent remaining life impact (PRLI) index is calculated. The results show an increase in the number of CR-related patents annually. China leads in the number of patent publications, while the US and other patent organizations have played critical roles in the field. An improved technology evolutionary path tracing visualization identifies several hotspots. Additionally, the policy strategy matrix (PSM) analyzes the industrial stimulation policies of the two countries with the most considerable proportion, providing an explanation for predicting future technology research and development (R&D) and the direction of optimization. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recent developments in sensing technologies and urban computing, however, integrate new data resources and technologies to tackle these challenges. Popular social networking platforms such as Twitter provide new data sources on important events (e.g., cultural activities, political campaigns, accidents, crises) providing rich knowledge about urban systems and human dynamics. This research is intended to develop a method for effectively monitoring important information during such events and helping with planning and policymaking. We use semantically similar and geographically close geo-topics to represent important local events. This research proposes a data-driven system for detecting and tracking the semantic, spatial, and temporal dynamics of these geo-topics, specifically designed for geo-tagged tweets. The system consists of data preprocessing, geo-topic generation, and geo-topic tracking modules. The preprocessing module can remove robotic and semantically trivial texts. In the geo-topic generation module, we use spatial factors to measure the spatial impacts of geo-tagged tweets by applying an exponential decay function to the pairwise distances between tweets. We then improve the dynamic topic model (DTM) by embedding the spatial factors to enable the generation of geo-topics in semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions simultaneously. The geo-topic tracking module monitors semantic change by detecting changes in certain keywords’ probabilities and the volumes of tweets belonging to different geo-topics. This module also uses radius of gyration and trajectory-pattern mining to track and analyze the movement patterns of geo-topics. We employed the tracking system in three disaster cases in different U.S. cities to track small-scale emergencies and crises. These implementations demonstrated the effectiveness of the system for identifying and tracking geo-topics at fine temporal and geographic scales. The system also has strong potential in creating planning-related analyses for policy makers, improving the situational awareness of the general public, and serving as a basis for urban information systems that contribute to smart, agile, and resilient city developments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While scholarly attention has focused on experiences expressed by informal caregivers in these communities, how caregivers’ challenges and emotional expressions vary across different health contexts remains understudied. Objective: We aimed to examine and compare the challenges discussed by informal caregivers of general older adults and those of patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia, as well as their emotional expressions, on Reddit. In addition, we examined how informal caregivers expressed their emotions in response to various challenges. Methods: We collected posts from 6 subreddits, including 3 subreddits on caregiving for older adults and 3 on caregiving for patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia. Using topic modeling, we identified topics discussed by caregivers in the collected posts. We further used deep reading to contextualize these topics and understand the challenges behind them, conducted sentiment analysis to investigate their emotional expressions, and used Spearman rank-order correlation to examine the relationship between the obtained topics and emotions. Results: In total, 3028 posts were retrieved, including 1552 from older adult–related subreddits and 1476 from Alzheimer disease–related subreddits; 18 key topics were identified, with the most frequent topics being expressing feelings (2178/3028, 71.93%) and seeking advice and support (1982/3028, 65.46%). Other topics covered various challenges in caregiving, such as duration of medical care (1954/3028, 64.53%), sleep and incontinence (1536/3028, 50.73%), financial issues (1348/3028, 44.52%), and nursing home (1221/3028, 40.32%). There was a positive, negligible correlation between expressing feelings and seeking advice and support (ρ=0.09, P<.001). Other topics also showed positive, negligible or weak correlations with these 2 topics but in distinct patterns. Posts from older adult–related subreddits were more focused on practical caregiving issues and seeking advice and support, whereas posts from Alzheimer disease–related subreddits emphasized health- and medical-related topics and expressing feelings. Caregivers in both contexts predominantly expressed negative emotions (older adults: 1263/1552, 81.38%; Alzheimer disease: 1247/1476, 84.49%), with caregivers in Alzheimer disease–related subreddits exhibiting slightly greater fear and sadness (P<.001). Specific challenges were significantly correlated with negative emotions: duration of medicalcare was positively, weakly correlated with anger (ρ=0.25, P<.001), fear (ρ=0.25, P<.001), and sadness (ρ=0.22, P<.001). Medical appointments were positively, negligibly correlated with anger (ρ=0.10, P<.001), fear (ρ=0.09, P<.001), and sadness (ρ=0.06, P<.001). Sleep and incontinence (ρ=0.14, P<.001) and finances (ρ=0.24, P<.001) were positively, weakly correlated with anger. Conclusions: By identifying the challenges and feelings expressed by caregivers for general older adults and caregivers for patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia, our findings could inform health practitioners and policy makers in developing more targeted support interventions for informal caregivers in different contexts. ©Nova Mengxia Huang, Liang Ze Wong, Shirley S Ho, Bryan Timothy.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Large language models (LLM), like ChatGPT, are considered a novel solution for delivering online psychological counseling. However, performance evaluation, emotional expression, high levels of anthropomorphism, ethical issues, transparency, and privacy breaches need to be addressed before LLM can be widely adopted. This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT's effectiveness and emotional support capabilities in providing mental health counseling services from both macro and micro perspectives to examine whether it possesses psychological support abilities comparable to those of human experts. Building on the macro-level evaluation, we conducted a deeper comparison of the linguistic differences between ChatGPT and human experts at the micro-level. In addition, to respond to current policy requirements regarding the labeling, we further explored how to identify artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) in counseling texts and which micro-level linguistic features can effectively distinguish AIGC from user-generated content (UGC). Finally, the study addressed transparency, privacy breaches, and ethical concerns. We utilized ChatGPT for psychological interventions, applying LLM to address various mental health issues. The BERTopic algorithm evaluated the content across multiple mental health problems. Deep learning techniques were employed to differentiate between AIGC and UGC in psychological counseling responses. Furthermore, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) evaluate interpretability, providing deeper insights into the decision-making process and enhancing transparency. At the macro level, ChatGPT demonstrated performance comparable to human experts, exhibiting professionalism, diversity, empathy, and a high degree of human likeness, making it highly effective in counseling services. At the micro level, deep learning models achieved accuracy rates of 99.12 % and 96.13 % in distinguishing content generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 from UGC, respectively. Interpretability analysis revealed that context, sentence structure, and emotional expression were key factors differentiating AIGC from UGC. The findings highlight ChatGPT's potential to deliver effective online psychological counseling and demonstrate a reliable framework for distinguishing between artificial intelligence-generated and human-generated content. This study underscores the importance of leveraging large-scale language models to support mental health services while addressing high-level anthropomorphic issues and ethical and practical challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims (a) to analyze the participation behavior of the elderly in leisure sports through big-data analysis and (b) to compare and analyze the motivations, limitations, and satisfaction of participation in leisure sports by age group. Methods: First, big-data analysis using text-mining technique was conducted using the TEXTOM program to collect and analyze data between May 1, 2023 and November 24, 2024. Next, a survey was conducted among adults aged 20 years and older who regularly participate in leisure sports to determine their motivations, limitations, and satisfaction with leisure participation. From June to December 2024, the data of 301 participants were collected and analyzed using SPSS 28.0. Specifically, this study analyzed the validity and reliability of the data and then compared and analyzed the three age groups through multivariate analysis of variance. Results: Big-data analysis identified key terms and four clusters related to senior leisure sports participation: (a) Policy, (b) Welfare, (c) Senior Sports, and (d) Employment. The results of the comparative study through the questionnaire showed that compared to younger participants in leisure sports, the elderly showed higher results in the factors of self-challenge motive, social interaction motive, and leisure participation satisfaction, but lower results in the factor of cost constraints. This means that the elderly participate in leisure sports for challenge and social interaction, are more satisfied, and are less constrained by cost. Conclusions: The scientific and objective results of this study could be used as a resource to specifically understand the leisure sports participation behavior of the elderly. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We use text mining techniques to reveal overlapping and exclusive terminologies used in academic articles on the three types of ecosystems. Processing of keywords has identified the current positioning of related domains in a tripartite framework. Keywords Network Analysis has revealed domains that share knowledge with the larger domains of Smart City, Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) and Helix interaction concepts, thereby providing insights into knowledge sharing across boundaries of BE, IE and DE. The results offer a basis for classification and baseline of current state of knowledge distribution across the ecosystems that can aid in ecosystems design, collaborations planning, interdisciplinary research and policy making. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The method, entirely based on textual analysis has two steps: (a) multi-terms selected from a policy document are used to retrieve documents from a publication database, (b) a LDA topic model fitted to the retrieved corpus allows to identify irrelevant topics and to remove the corresponding documents. Once the corpus is cleaned, topics are clustered on the base of their semantic proximities and of their co-occurrence in documents for structuring the domain into main research themes. The method is applied to a selected facet of the food security challenge and provides a representative sample of research works in the domain. Structuring the corpus into six research themes allows to compare the thematic profiles and the research practices of twelve countries most involved in the domain. © 2015 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Recent works based on this paradigm have achieved state-of-the-art results in several of the mostly deterministic offline Atari and D4RL benchmarks. However, because these methods jointly model the states and actions as a single sequencing problem, they struggle to disentangle the effects of the policy and world dynamics on the return. Thus, in adversarial or stochastic environments, these methods lead to overly optimistic behavior that can be dangerous in safety-critical systems like autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a method that addresses this optimism bias by explicitly disentangling the policy and world models, which allows us at test time to search for policies that are robust to multiple possible futures in the environment. We demonstrate our method's superior performance on a variety of autonomous driving tasks in simulation.

For complex business processes, this results in huge amount of policy documents. Given the large volume of policies, manually analyzing policy documents to discover process information imposes excessive cognitive load. In order to provide a solution to this problem, we have proposed previously a novel approach named Policy-based Process Mining (PBPM) to automatically extracting process models from policy documents using information extraction techniques. In this paper, we report our recent findings in an important PBPM step called task identification. Our investigation indicates that task identification from policy documents is quite challenging because it is not a typical information extraction problem. The novelty of our approach is to formalize task identification as a problem of extracting relations among three process components, i.e., resource, action, and data while using sequence kernel techniques. Our initial experiment produced very promising results.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, few have deployed the content analysis of the joint statements between both countries in order to grasp the change of the relationship in different time frames. In fact, grasping the trend change of the US-China relationship is imperative for academic researchers and policy makers. In this paper, we analyzed the trend change of the US-China relationship by means of applying the text mining analysis to two joint statements in the years of 2009 and 2011. The contribution of this study included the following two points. First, the study has found the main focus of the Joint Statements shifted from mutual cooperation to the focuses of economic development, investment and the continuity of bilateral relations. Second, the study found a new way of literature survey in diplomatic studies by using the text mining method in order to explore the trend change. © Sila Science.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, we perform a sentiment analysis for measuring long-term trends in public opinion during the 2016 Indian demonetisation policy using Twitter data. We compare our findings to prior research and reports retrieved from media and sources. We utilise Rapid Miner sentiment classifier to a post-event of extending the deadline to deposit the forfeit banknotes. The results indicate an attitude that is predominantly continuing to oppose towards demonetisation policy implementation. We recommend from this study that a multi-lingual sentiment be employed to process non-polarised tweets in local languages in future work. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study employs a unified evidence synthesis framework that integrates aggregative, configurative, and narrative synthesis methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of AI, NLP, and AIoT on environmental sustainability in urban areas. The study delves into critical research questions concerning the core principles of emerging smarter eco-cities, including their design, infrastructure, and governance models. It also explores the key drivers behind the realization of these eco-cities, such as technological advancements, policy initiatives, and societal demands for sustainable living environments. Furthermore, the study investigates the primary AI, NLP, and AIoT solutions that contribute to environmental sustainability practices in smart cities. This includes technologies like predictive analytics for energy efficiency, smart waste management systems, and AI-powered urban planning tools that optimize resource allocation and reduce environmental impact. The findings of this study enrich our understanding of how AI, NLP, and IoT technologies can positively impact sustainable urban development. However, they also highlight the challenges associated with their implementation, such as data privacy concerns, technological dependencies, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders. Overall, these insights empower policymakers, urban planners, and technology developers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI-driven urbanism. By making more informed decisions and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being, stakeholders can create smarter and more sustainable cities for the future. © 2025 Scrivener Publishing LLC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Politicians are generally seeking effective public policies that favourably impacts citizens' satisfaction. Citizen satisfaction index is a plausible mechanism for public policy makers to monitor and evaluate the public policies. While surveys on citizen satisfaction are common among agile and progressive public administration and governments, automating the computation of citizen's' satisfaction is challenging. Given that surveys and evaluations related to citizen satisfaction are retrospective, remedial actions when necessary are always somewhat late. We describe in this poster a predictive analytics framework for citizen satisfaction with respect to public policy based on the previous citizen sentiments past related policies. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Despite the essential role of institutions in facilitating the transition to renewable energy, systematic research on this relationship remains scarce. This study addresses this gap by being the first to apply Topic Modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation – LDA) to systematically analyze the literature, offering a data-driven alternative to conventional reviews and minimizing subjective bias. We hypothesize that the interaction between institutional quality and renewable energy is multifaceted, with key areas influencing each other in an interconnected manner. To test this, we apply LDA to analyze 570 academic documents published from 1998 to 2024. The analysis identifies five prominent topics: Investments (17.2 %), Emissions (22.3 %), Finance (17.3 %), Environment (20.2 %), and Economic growth (23 %). Most documents exhibit a maximum probability of belonging to a topic within 25 %–35 %, with some reaching 40 %–50 %. Although a moderate negative correlation is observed between topics, overlapping themes and interconnections are discovered. By leveraging LDA, this study systematically categorizes and analyzes research trends, offering an objective and scalable method to uncover latent themes in the discourse on institutional quality and renewable energy.

This method can learn a group's preference by automatically integrating its members preferences without integrating policy, and analyze group/user preferences and understand group/user behaviors by using multi-view text mining. Specifically, in order to integrate rich group to item interaction information into the model, we designed a graph convolution network (GCN) model based on multi-topic learning, and denote the new model as topic-based graph convolution network via LLM (T-GCN-LLM). By applying graph convolutions on the multi-topic association graphs, the model can make a comprehensive representations for groups and users through using embeddings contained in multiple topics, so as to improve the group recommendations. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to evaluate the T-GCN-LLM, the results demonstrate that our model can better represent the interactions between groups and items than many novel and high quality group recommendation methods. At the same time, the interpretability analysis experiment also proves the importance of incorporating the topics into the model to improve the interpretability of group recommendations. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The results of the emerging theory explain that the concerns of users can be categorized as relating to data management, data surveillance, data invasion, technical safety, or legal & policy issues. The results show that over time, mHealth users are still concerned about areas such as security breaches, real-time data invasion, surveillance, and how companies use the data collected from these devices. Further, the results from the emotion and sentiment analyses revealed that users generally exhibited anger and fear, and sentiments that were negatively expressed. Theoretically, the results also support the literature on user acceptance of mHealth wearables as influenced by the distrust of companies and their utilization of personally harvested data. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

While accomplishments in this regard are constantly measured, European citizens are not always aware of the policy‘s impact and the role the EU plays therein. This is especially relevant as the communication of EU policies is central to the emergence of a European public sphere, an acknowledged condition for European integration. In this paper, we aim at advancing research in this regard through the analysis of cohesion policy communication on the social media channels of ten Local Managing Authorities (LMAs) responsible for managing and communicating structural funds at the local level. By building on a bottom-up construction of shared meaning structures through semi-automatic analysis techniques, we make the following three observations: first, social media communication is indicative of ‘horizontal Europeanization'; second, Europeanization occurs both in the form of the spontaneous amalgamation of shared discontent expressed by citizens and the institutionalization of top-down EU communication measures adopted by LMAs; and third, a cluster of topics articulated internationally and showcasing a negative attitude towards the EU funding scheme suggests that, counter-intuitively, Euroscepticism seems to facilitate the emergence of a European public sphere. © 2020 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Considering that microblogged geo-locational information offers new insight into human attitudes, the present research examined the utility of geo-social media data for understanding how different active and inactive travel modes affect feelings of pleasure, or displeasure, in two major US cities: Chicago, Illinois and Washington DC. A popular approach was used to derive a sentiment index (pleasure or valence) for each travel Tweet. Methodologically, exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and global and spatial regression models were used to examine the geography of all travel modes and factors affecting their valence. After adjusting for spatial error associated with socioeconomic, environmental, weather and temporal factors, spatial autoregression models proved superior to the base global model. The results showed that water and pedestrian travel were universally associated with positive valences. Bicycling also favourably influenced valence, albeit only in DC. A noteworthy finding was the negative influence temperature and humidity had on valence. The outcomes from this research should be considered when additional evidence is needed to elevate commuter sentiment values in practice and policy, especially in regards to active transportation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We extract several latent topics of interest to the community from the text corpus by applying the unsupervised learning method of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and explore the amount of interests received by each topic by applying the supervised learning methods, including the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and the Bayesian LASSO model. Results reveal much more attentions paid by the audience to the sensational news, especially the controversies related to Hillary Clinton’s email leakage and Donald Trump’s anti-political-correctness and anti-globalization remarks, than to the substantive issues, e.g., regarding the candidates’ policy agendas or the democratic process. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In fulfilling the present legal gap, enacted soft law regulation has been laid out, and a detailed systematic literature review was conducted in the paper presented. The specific methodological approach was selected to deal with two crucial research tasks: to reveal and recommend fundamental governing mechanisms regarding the use and application of generative artificial intelligence; more precisely, large language models in educational systems. Three systematically guided layers of quantitative and qualitative content analysis of central policy, legislation, and regulatory mechanisms in governing AI in education were extracted from the 142 Scopus Database and Web of Science research papers analyzed and presented. These research findings benefit policymakers, regulatory and legislative bodies, and agencies in constructing governing frames for using and applying generative artificial intelligence in education. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this work, we posit that personalizing access to decision support tools can be an effective mechanism for instantiating the appropriate use of AI assistance. Specifically, we propose the general problem of learning a decision support policy that, for a given input, chooses which form of support to provide to decision-makers for whom we initially have no prior information. We develop Modiste, an interactive tool to learn personalized decision support policies. Modiste leverages stochastic contextual bandit techniques to personalize a decision support policy for each decision-maker. In our computational experiments, we characterize the expertise profiles of decision-makers for whom personalized policies will outperform offline policies, including population-wide baselines. Our experiments include realistic forms of support (e.g., expert consensus and predictions from a large language model) on vision and language tasks. Our human subject experiments add nuance to and bolster our computational experiments, demonstrating the practical utility of personalized policies when real users benefit from accessing support across tasks.

In concert with these technological changes, students are also facing increasing pressure to succeed in their academic pursuits. Inasmuch as the consequences of failure in these contexts are often dire academically, socially, and financially, we argue that students often weigh the choice to plagiarize not as an ethical issue but as a pragmatic mitigation of risk. Using three salient examples of plagiarism and cheating from higher education in North America as case studies, we explore the pressures and contexts that have influenced the choice to engage in plagiarism and cheating through this pragmatic lens. As an ethical framing of the issue of academic integrity has been less effective in ameliorating plagiarism in this pressurized climate, we propose a way in which educators, administrators and policy makers might approach the issue in this same pragmatic frame. In short, rather than combat plagiarism by teaching its moral repugnance, we propose educators could argue instead that plagiarism and cheating are pragmatically untenable simply because they are detrimental to learning. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

PCG is defined as the generation of game content tailored to the defined evaluation function using RL models, which is one of the examples of PCG via machine learning. Compared to other generation content areas such as computer vision and natural language process, generative models such as variational autoencoders, PixelCNN, and generative adversarial networks exhibit some difficulties for applications to the game area because during the development of a new game, the content data used for training is typically not sufficient. Hence, RL is considered to be used as a method for PCG. In particular, the stage of turn-based RPG is selected as our research target because it comprises discrete sections, and its parameters were closely related; hence, it is a challenge to generate desirable stages, and the main goal is to generate various stages guided by the designed evaluation function. Two RL models, Deep Q-Network and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, respectively, are selected, and the generated stages are evaluated as 0.78 and 0.85 by our designed function, respectively. By the application of the stochastic noise policy, diverse stages are successfully obtained, and those diversities are evaluated by the parameter mse and the different number of valid strategies. © 2019 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, while most land bank-related studies have focused on socioeconomic dynamics (income levels, unemployment rate, etc.) through the program, there is a lack of direct research on residential satisfaction changes. Additionally, surveys were frequently used in previous studies to evaluate residential satisfaction; however, this method has disadvantages, including constraints on time and cost, and the inability to take into account external factors that may affect residential satisfaction. Furthermore, most studies on urban decline have focused primarily on declining factors, and there have been few investigations into how cities change as urban regeneration strategies advance. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to identify the influence of the land bank program on residential satisfaction by using Twitter data. Approximately 300,000 Twitter posts containing location information generated within the city of Detroit were collected to determine the degree of sensitivity to each tweet and categorized into positive and negative emotions to determine the relationship between residential satisfaction and the land bank program. As a result, the increase in homeownership, built year, house value, and the number of land banking sold properties were found to have a negative effect on neighborhood satisfaction in Detroit. Although the research results indicated that while the land bank program did not significantly improve residential satisfaction in Detroit, it has made a partial contribution to improving living standards. These findings emphasize the importance of enhancing residential satisfaction and suggest the need for policy change. In response to the problem of urban contraction, it seems that indiscriminately distributing houses is not the only solution to prevent urban shrinkage. Furthermore, this study shows meaningful results on text mining and provides the possibility of developing research using social network services. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The aim is to provide targeted guidance for government policy￣making and public opinion governance. Specifically, this paper utilizes social networks represented by Weibo, based on the divided public opinion lifecycle and stakeholders, and integrates Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) topic modeling, ERNIE 3.0 sentiment analysis, and word co￣occurrence network analysis methods to conduct an in￣depth analysis of online comments related to unexpected natural disasters from multiple dimensions of content features, spatiotemporal characteristics, and network characteristics. This reveals the evolution characteristics of public opinion among various stakeholders in the public opinion events of heavy rain and flood in Hebei. The research results show that ordinary netizens have focused and diverse concerns, while online media focuses on centralized and singular themes. Opinion leaders tend to capitalize on traffic, and official media focuses on disaster warnings and reassuring the public. It is worth noting that in addition to the disaster￣stricken areas, the locations of major media outlets, which are high￣risk areas for public opinion crises, should also be given priority attention, and relevant departments urgently need to strengthen the guidance and supervision of public opinion in the latter. The method proposed in this paper not only improves the accuracy of topic mining, but also achieves accurate characterization of the multi￣dimensional characteristics of different stakeholders in each public opinion cycle. This research can provide targeted guidance and emergency plans for online public opinion crises triggered by unexpected natural disasters such as heavy rain and floods. © 2025 Institute of Engineering Mechanics (IEM).

Specifically, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a dataset of manually annotated sentences on monetary policy stance. We derive a deep learning domain-specific model—BERT central bank sentiment index—ready for sentiment predictions. The proposed index performs similarly to other measures in capturing financial uncertainty. Also, the sentiment index is less noisy and has the ability to forecast the future path of policy stance, augmenting the standard Taylor rule. Finally, compared to other lexicon-based sentiment indicators, our deep learning index has a higher predictive power in anticipating policy rates changes. Our framework enables future possible research in developing more accurate sentiment indicators for central banks in both advanced and emerging countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

With access policy governance now an executive-level responsibility, it is imperative that such a tool expose the policy to business users - with little or no IT intervention - as natural language. NIST SP 800-162. [1] first prescribes natural language policies (NLPs) as the preferred expression of policy and then implicitly calls for automated translation of NLP to machine-executable code. This paper therefore proposes an interoperable model for the NLP's human expression. It furthermore documents the research and development of a tool set for end-to-end authoring and translation. This R&D journey - focusing constantly on end users - has debunked certain myths, has responded to steadily increasing market sophistication, has applied formal disciplines (e.g. ontologies, grammars and compiler design) and has motivated an informal demonstration of autonomic code generation. The lessons learned should be of practical value to the entire ABAC community. The research in progress - increasingly complex policies, proactive rule analytics, and expanded NLP authoring language support - will require collaboration with an ever-expanding technical community from industry and academia. © 2017 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

As a consequence, modelling, measuring and monitoring the rate and direction of technological change has been extensively studied. However, there is to-date no scalable, cross-domain, and data source agnostic quantitative indicator for technological change that considers a combinatorial process of invention and technology development. This paper develops and empirically tests a network-based method that takes a combinatorial view of technological development as underlying rationale and provides a quantitative indicator for technological change. Unlike prior research, the proposed method allows for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple and diverse types of data sources, i.e. publications, patents, and projects and it uses text-mining analyses based on co-occurrences of terms over time. The novel method proposed here goes beyond reliance on domain experts building custom sets of taxonomies, is applicable across different technological domains, and permits a temporal analysis of changes across years, industries, and countries. This is illustrated using a large database of worldwide bioenergy research and development (R&D) records. Findings include the detection of biofuel generations in the data before they were first mentioned as such in literature. Implications for research, industry and policy are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Many organizations are adopting information security management systems and pursuing certifications like ISO 27001. However, the process of creating and maintaining these policies is often manual and time-consuming. Organizations must merge requirements from different frameworks and stay updated with evolving regulations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models, specifically fine-tuning a pretrained BERT model. Our research focuses on automatically identifying and matching cybersecurity requirements, particularly those outlined in ISO 27001. This approach aims to support the merging of requirements from various frameworks into a unified policy and ensure the consistency of company-specific policies with updated frameworks over time. By utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques and the power of BERT, we aim to streamline the process of policy creation and maintenance, reducing manual effort and enabling organizations to stay compliant with changing regulations. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

Therefore, the current study offers a literature review targeting tourism and hospitality stakeholders’ perceptions of past diseases and has three objectives: (1) Explore major topics from previous research on infectious diseases using topic modeling; (2) compare non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 crises; (3) investigate research topics in the tourism and hospitality industries. To meet our research objectives, we reviewed published pandemic-related articles in the tourism and hospitality literature since the year 2000. Based on the results, we first identified nine key topics related to infectious diseases (i.e., policy, human resources, branding, resilience, technology, global or community change, risk perception, disease impact, and lifestyle). Second, we suggest the application of different topic weights in non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 research. Third, we found that it is appropriate to apply different topic weights in tourism and hospitality research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using Natural Language Processing to Read 461 California City General Plans\n                    ABSTRACT: Land-use control is local and highly varied. State agencies struggle to assess plan contents. Similarly, advocacy groups and planning researchers wrestle with the length of planning documents and ability to compare across plans. The goal of this research is to (1) introduce Natural Language Processing techniques that can automate qualitative coding in planning research and (2) provide policy-relevant exploratory findings. We assembled a database of 461 California city-level General Plans, extracted the text, and used topic modeling to identify areas of emphasis (clusters of co-occurring words). We find that California city general plans address more than sixty topics, including greenhouse gas mitigation and Climate Action Planning. Through spatializing results, we find that a quarter of the topics in plans are regionally specific. We also quantify the rift and convergence of planning topics. The topics focused on housing have very little overlap with other planning topics. This is likely a factor of state requirements to update and evolve the Housing Elements every five years, but not other aspects of General Plans. This finding has policy implications as housing topics evolve away from other emphasis areas such as transportation and economic development. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach reveals that many cities have had a focus on environmental justice through Health and Wellness Elements well before the state mandate in 2019. Our searchable state-level database of general plans is the first for California—and nationally. We provide a model for others that wish to comprehensively assess and compare plan contents using machine learning. © The Author(s) 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this way, the healthcare providers and the policy makers can acquire and process the data of a patient despite its initial format and source, allowing an improved quality of patient care and optimizing the management of the financial resources. To further exploit this huge resource of health and social data, it is very important to allow the extraction of the complex information buried under the Big Data source enabled by the EHRs, providing the physicians, the researchers and public health policy makers with innovative instruments. Meeting this need is not a trivial task, due to the difficulties of processing different document formats and processing Natural Language text, alongside to the problems related to the data size. In this paper we propose a Big Data architecture that is able to extract information from the documents acquired by the EHRs, integrate and process them, providing a set of valuable data for both physicians and patients, as well as decision makers. © 2019 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

At this stage, the opposition to the vaccine seen in the society or the lack of trust in the developed vaccine is an important factor hampering vaccination activities. In this study, aspect-base sentiment analysis was conducted for USA, U.K., Canada, Turkey, France, Germany, Spain and Italy showing the approach of twitter users to vaccination and vaccine types during the COVID-19 period. Within the scope of this study, two datasets in English and Turkish were prepared with 928,402 different vaccine-focused tweets collected by country. In the classification of tweets, 4 different aspects (policy, health, media and other) and 4 different BERT models (mBERT-base, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT and BERTurk) were used. 6 different COVID-19 vaccines with the highest frequency among the datasets were selected and sentiment analysis was made by using Twitter posts regarding these vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to understand people's views about vaccination and types of vaccines. With the experiments conducted, the results of the views of the people on vaccination and vaccine types were presented according to the countries. The success of the method proposed in this study in the F1 Score was between 84% and 88% in datasets divided by country, while the total accuracy value was 87%.  © 2013 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Drawing on resource dependence theory and informational perspectives on parliamentary committees, we analyse the impact of information provided by business interest organizations, public interest groups, and experts in the German Bundestag’s public hearings in 2004, 2007, and 2011. Using a text-reuse approach to capture legislative amendments, we assess the influence of different information types in explaining such changes. Our results show that the Bundestag often amends government proposals, and that interest groups’ positions and experts’ evidence must be considered when explaining such amendments. We demonstrate that parliament is more responsive to business pressure than to public interest groups, which are heavily dependent on political allies in governing parties. Finally, we show that expert advice can inform policy-makers and legitimize government bills, but can also disempower public interest groups. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Exploring Indian Parliamentary debates helps grasp their linguistic characteristics, rhetorical strategies, and political implications. Analysing speeches aims to understand how language is used to persuade, argue, and negotiate in this context, shedding light on the dynamics of Indian democracy and parliamentary discourse. This research paper highlights the use of natural language processing to comprehend the hidden patterns in Lok Sabha’s speeches, aka the House of People, which were collected from its official website. 5000 speeches were extracted, and a subset was manually annotated into five categories—Appreciate, Neutral, Call For Action, Blame, and Issue. The data was preprocessed to determine the sentiment, key phrases, similarity, gender distribution, and category classification. Multiple baseline machine learning models were implemented, such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SGD classifiers, and deep neural networks. The logistic regression model gave the best performance with an accuracy of 55%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

South Korea occupational safety and health has implemented new policies addressing potential risks to overcome stagnation in industrial accident reduction and predict site accidents from past cases. Cases are human-classified according to rules, including occurrence type or original causal materials. However, human errors, subjective judgments, synonyms, and terms incorrectly used by classifiers reduce original data quality and impede developments or applications of policies, technologies, and methods preventing accidents based on past accidents. This study proposes three artificial intelligence models to objectively classify the occurrence type of accident cases. Models are developed based on a natural language processing model (KoBERT), which considers Korean language characteristics. Each model is tested by sequentially performing sentence preprocessing, keyword replacement, and morphological analysis. The proposed Model 3 exhibits 93.1% accuracy, which was the highest among tested models. Up to three classification categories for occurrence type are allowed to assist objective classification. The accident case-based occurrence type classification model is effective for industrial accident prevention, aiding in strategy development and reducing social costs. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Online news articles are one of the main data sources that present up-to-date business news offered by various companies in the market. Topic modeling, i.e. a key player in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, helps businesses to drive value from news articles. Also, it supports the extraction of business insights from news articles to facilitate the identification of trends (topics) in the market and their evolution over time. These insights can help businesses not only automate routine tasks but also in building new marketing policies, decision-making, and customer support. It is also important to find the linked semantic information (i.e. key persons, organizations, or regions called named entities) involved in generating these topics for the identification of news sources. This paper presents the application of a hybrid approach based on dynamic topic modeling and Named-Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting business trends along with the related entities. To show the functionality of the proposed approach, the news articles collected from the websites that published the content related to company interests were from 2017 to 2021 inclusive. The proposed approach can serve as the foundation for future exploratory trend analysis to study the evolution of information not only in the business domain but also applicable in other domains.

The increased customer expectations, changing ownership, self-driving vehicles, and much more have led to the transformation of automobiles, applications, and services from artificial intelligence, sensors, RFID to big data analysis. Large automobile industries have been emphasizing the collection of data to gain insight into customer’s expectations, preferences, and budgets alongside competitor’s policies. Statistical methods can be applied to historical data, which has been gathered from various authentic sources and can be used to identify the impact of fixed and variable marketing investments and support automakers to come up with a more effective, precise, and efficient approach to target customers. Proper analysis of supply chain data can disclose the weak links in the chain enabling the adoption of timely countermeasures to minimize the adverse effects. To fully gain benefit from analytics, the collaboration of a detailed set of capabilities responsible for intersecting and integrating with multiple functions and teams across the business is required. The effective role played by big data analysis in the automobile industry has also been expanded in the research paper. The research paper discusses the scope and challenges of big data. The paper also elaborates on the working technology behind the concept of big data. The paper illustrates the working of MapReduce technology that executes in the back end and is responsible for performing data mining. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Product reviews, trends, and political commentary can all be found on Twitter. Twitter may be used to assess public sentiment toward current events, legislation, social movements and public figures, as well as the attitudes, feelings and opinions of various individuals. Opinion mining can be accomplished without manually reading tweets using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. This data can be used to launch new policies, products, and events by governments and corporations alike. When it comes to categorising tweets according to their emotional content, there are a number of models that have been developed for classifying tweets as love, joy, sad, anger, fear, anxiety. The proposed Ensemble Classifier (LSTM-GRU) was determined to be the most effective after a thorough evaluation of its performance.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this narrative review, we present a selection of representative examples of generative AI applications in medicine and healthcare. We then briefly discuss some associated issues, such as trust, veracity, clinical safety and reliability, privacy, copyrights, ownership, and opportunities, e.g., AI-driven conversational user interfaces for friendlier human-computer interaction. We conclude that generative AI will play an increasingly important role in medicine and healthcare as it further evolves and gets better tailored to the unique settings and requirements of the medical domain and as the laws, policies and regulatory frameworks surrounding its use start taking shape. © 2023 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

What has been largely missing in the literature is the temporal dimension, i.e., the changes over time in key variables such as organizational environment, firm strategic adaptations, and the performance implications. In this study, we investigate environment and strategic adaptations 12 years after Tan and Litschert examined these issues in 1990. Following a staged model, the study found that (1) organizational environment and firm strategic adaptations have co-evolved over time, (2) a new configuration has emerged and is related to improved performance, and (3) such a relationship is moderated by the stage during transition in which firms were founded. Specifically, firms founded since 1990 are more proactive and innovative than firms that had existed in the previous stage.

Twitter has attracted the attention of many researchers owing to the fact that every tweet is by default, public in nature which is not the case with Facebook. This paper proposes a model for multi-lingual (English and Roman Urdu) classification of tweets over diversely ranged classes (non-hierarchical architecture). Previous work in tweet classification is narrowly focused either on single language or either on uniform set of classes at most (Positive, Extremely Positive, Negative and Extremely Negative). The proposed model is based on semi-supervised learning and proposed feature selection approach makes it less dependent and highly adaptive for grabbing trending terms. This makes it a strong contender of choice for streaming data. In the methodology, using Naïve Bayes learning algorithm for each phase, obtained remarkable accuracy of up to 87.16% leading from both KNN and SVM models which are popular for NLP and Text classification domains. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These efforts have resulted in different QA models capable of answering questions on various topics. Research shows that existing QA models perform well on generic questions (e.g., about sports, news, and common knowledge); however, the ability of QA models to answer basic but important questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies is unknown. In this paper, we first derived a set of 43 basic questions concerning mobile apps’ privacy policies based on global privacy laws. Then, we constructed two datasets of labeled (Passage, Question, Answer) 3-tuples. Finally, we conducted two main experiments to evaluate the ability and effectiveness of existing QA models in answering basic questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies. Our experimental results show that (1) existing QA models perform poorly in answering basic questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies, and (2) fine-tuning existing QA models using our QA datasets can help improve their performance. We hope our datasets and findings can help researchers build better QA models for more accurately answering questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Design/methodology/approach: To test the proposed conjectures, the authors collected longitudinal data in collaboration with a leading company that operates more than 500 WeChat official accounts in China. This study proposed a text mining framework to extract and quantify clickbait rhetorical features (i.e. hyperbole, insinuation, puzzle, and visual rhetoric). Econometric analysis was employed for empirical validation. Findings: The findings revealed that (1) hyperbole, insinuation, and visual rhetoric entice users to click the baited headlines, (2) there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of clickbait headlines posted by a publisher and its visit traffic, and (3) this non-linear relationship is moderated by the publisher's age. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes to current literature on clickbait detection and clickbait consequences. Future studies can design more sophisticated methods for extracting rhetorical characteristics and implement in different languages. Practical implications: The findings could aid online media publishers to design attractive headlines and develop clickbait strategies to avoid user churn, and help managers enact appropriate regulations and policies to control clickbait prevalence. Originality/value: The authors propose a novel text mining framework to quantify rhetoric embedded in clickbait. This study empirically investigates antecedents and consequences of clickbait prevalence through an exploratory study of WeChat in China. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Conventional approaches to decision making face challenges related to low sample efficiency and poor generalization. In contrast, foundation models in language and vision have showcased rapid adaptation to diverse new tasks. Therefore, we advocate for the construction of foundation agents as a transformative shift in the learning paradigm of agents. This proposal is underpinned by the formulation of foundation agents with their fundamental characteristics and challenges motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we specify the roadmap of foundation agents from large interactive data collection or generation, to self-supervised pretraining and adaptation, and knowledge and value alignment with LLMs. Lastly, we pinpoint critical research questions derived from the formulation and delineate trends for foundation agents supported by real-world use cases, addressing both technical and theoretical aspects to propel the field towards a more comprehensive and impactful future.

Factors such as the high incidence of both emerging and existing infectious diseases, delays in vaccinations, and routine exposure in communal settings heighten children's susceptibility to infections. Despite this pressing need, a comprehensive exploration of research trends in this domain remains lacking. This study aims to address this gap by employing text mining and modeling techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature, thereby identifying emerging research trends in infectious disease prevention among children. Methods: A cross-sectional text mining approach was adopted, focusing on journal articles published between January 1, 2003, and August 31, 2022. These articles, related to infectious disease prevention in children, were sourced from databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, and Korean RISS. The data underwent preprocessing using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python, with a semantic network analysis and topic modeling conducted using R software. Results: The final dataset comprised 509 journal articles extracted from multiple databases. The study began with a word frequency analysis to pinpoint relevant themes, subsequently visualized through a word cloud. Dominant terms encompassed “vaccination,” “adolescent,” “infant,” “parent,” “family,” “school,” “country,” “household,” “community,” “HIV,” “HPV,” “COVID-19,” “influenza,” and “diarrhea.” The semantic analysis identified “age” as a key term across infection, control, and intervention discussions. Notably, the relationship between “hand” and “handwashing” was prominent, especially in educational contexts linked with “school” and “absence.” Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling further delineated seven topics related to infectious disease prevention for children, encompassing (1) educational programs, (2) vaccination efforts, (3) family-level responses, (4) care for immunocompromised individuals, (5) country-specific responses, (6) school-based strategies, and (7) persistent threats from established infectious diseases. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the indispensable role of personalized interventions tailored for various child demographics, highlighting the pivotal contributions of both parental guidance and school participation. Clinical Relevance: The study provides insights into the complex public health challenges associated with preventing and managing infectious diseases in children. The insights derived could inform the formulation of evidence-based public health policies, steering practical interventions and fostering interdisciplinary synergy for holistic prevention strategies. © 2024 Sigma Theta Tau International.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

As a result of the Korea Housing Survey in 2020, the percentage of households living in apartments among general households in Korea was 51.1%, but there is insufficient research to understand public perception and trends of the balcony vegetable gardens. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the trends of balcony vegetable gardens over the last 4 years including before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and to provide basic data for effective application to related policies and research. Methods: A total of 5,011 posts that mentioned balcony vegetable gardens were collected from Naver blogs and cafes from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2021. To tokenize nouns, Okt morphological analysis of KoNLPy was used, and keywords were derived using TfidfVectorizer of Scikit-learn library. Following that, LDA topic modeling was performed by setting the hyper parameters as α= 0.1, β = 0.01 and iterations = 1,000. The above analysis was conducted using Python 3.9.5. Results: Before the outbreak of COVID-19, balcony vegetable gardening began to receive attention and vitalized as a form of participation in urban agriculture, but after the outbreak, they are established as an activity for healing, emotional support, environmental campaign, and healthy hobby. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, people clearly seemed to seek a more sustainable lifestyle through balcony vegetable garden activities. This shows the values and expected outcomes the public has toward urban agriculture. Conclusion: Balcony gardening activities heal the public, and this healing effect could be a key to the revitalization and development of urban agriculture. These findings can help establish policies and set the directions for urban agriculture that reflect the values and expected outcomes the public has toward urban agricultural activities. © 2022 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Approximately 800,000 individuals die by suicide yearly, and for every suicide death, there are another 20 estimated suicide attempts. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to enhance scalable, accessible, and affordable digital services for suicide prevention and self-harm interventions. However, their use also raises clinical and ethical questions that require careful consideration. Objective: This scoping review aims to identify emergent trends in LLM applications in the field of suicide prevention and self-harm research. In addition, it summarizes key clinical and ethical considerations relevant to this nascent area of research. Methods: Searches were conducted in 4 databases (PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) in February 2024. Eligible studies described the application of LLMs for suicide or self-harm prevention, detection, or management. English-language peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings were included, without date restrictions. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesize study characteristics, objectives, models, data sources, proposed clinical applications, and ethical considerations. This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) standards. Results: Of the 533 studies identified, 36 (6.8%) met the inclusion criteria. An additional 7 studies were identified through citation chaining, resulting in 43 studies for review. The studies showed a bifurcation of publication fields, with varying publication norms between computer science and mental health. While most of the studies (33/43, 77%) focused on identifying suicide risk, newer applications leveraging generative functions (eg, support, education, and training) are emerging. Social media was the most common source of LLM training data. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was the predominant model used, although generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) featured prominently in generative applications. Clinical LLM applications were reported in 60% (26/43) of the studies, often for suicide risk detection or as clinical assistance tools. Ethical considerations were reported in 33% (14/43) of the studies, with privacy, confidentiality, and consent strongly represented. Conclusions: This evolving research area, bridging computer science and mental health, demands a multidisciplinary approach. While open access models and datasets will likely shape the field of suicide prevention, documenting their limitations and potential biases is crucial. High-quality training data are essential for refining these models and mitigating unwanted biases. Policies that address ethical concerns—particularly those related to privacy and security when using social media data—are imperative. Limitations include high variability across disciplines in how LLMs and study methodology are reported. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence signals a shift in approach, particularly in applications related to care, support, and education, such as improved crisis care and gatekeeper training methods, clinician copilot models, and improved educational practices. Ongoing human oversight—through human-in-the-loop testing or expert external validation—is essential for responsible development and use. © Glenn Holmes, Biya Tang, Sunil Gupta, Svetha Venkatesh, Helen Christensen, Alexis Whitton.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study explores the role of the public service hotline 12345, a grassroots initiative in Shanghai, in capturing public sentiment and assessing the effectiveness of anti-smoking regulations. Our research aims to accurately and deeply understand the implementation and feedback of smoking control policies: by identifying high-frequency points and prominent issues in smoking control work based on the smoking control work order data received by the health hotline 12320. The results of this study will assist government enforcement agencies in improving smoking monitoring and clarify the direction for improving smoking control measures. Text-mining techniques were employed to analyze a dataset comprising 78011 call sheets, all related to tobacco control and collected from the hotline between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2019. This methodological approach aims to uncover prevalent themes and sentiments in the public discourse on smoking and its regulation, as reflected in the hotline interactions. Our study identified hotspots and the issues of greatest concern to citizens. Additionally, it provided recommendations to enforcement agencies to enhance their capabilities, optimize the allocation of human resources for smoking control monitoring, reduce enforcement costs and support for anti-smoking campaigns, thereby contributing to more effective tobacco control policies in the region. © 2024 Zhao T. et al.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Financial markets, e.g., stock markets, forex, and mercantile exchanges, etc., provide the opportunity to anyone to invest and generate finances. However, to reap maximum benefits from these financial markets, effective decision making is required to identify the trade directions, e.g., going long/short by analyzing all the influential factors, e.g., price action, economic policies, and supply/demand estimation, in a timely manner. In this regard, analysis of the financial news and Twitter posts plays a significant role to predict the future behavior of financial markets, public sentiment estimation, and systematic/idiosyncratic risk estimation. In this paper, our proposed work aims to analyze the Twitter posts and Google Finance data to predict the future behavior of the stock markets (one of the key financial markets) in a particular time frame, i.e., hourly, daily, weekly, etc., through a novel StockSentiWordNet (SSWN) model. The proposed SSWN model extends the standard opinion lexicon named SentiWordNet (SWN) through the terms specifically related to the stock markets to train extreme learning machine (ELM) and recurrent neural network (RNN) for stock price prediction. The experiments are performed on two datasets, i.e., Sentiment140 and Twitter datasets, and achieved the accuracy value of 86.06%. Findings show that our work outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with respect to overall accuracy. In future, we plan to enhance the capability of our method by adding other popular social media, e.g., Facebook and Google News etc. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The American states offer a rich place to study constitutional innovation and imitation as being among the first political bodies to adopt constitutions and also given that they often replaced them, in both cases innovating and learning from one another. In this paper, we use quantitative text analysis to identify constitutional innovation and to investigate patterns of imitation. First, we find substantial textual borrowing between state constitutions. On average, 20 percent of a state’s constitutional language was borrowed directly from another state constitution. Second, states were more likely to borrow text from geographically proximate states, from temporally proximate state constitutions, and from states that shared similar partisan profiles. Finally, we offer a brief discussion of the most influential constitutions as an exploratory example for extending our approach of identifying textual innovation and imitation. These findings offer new contributions to both the study of constitutional design and institutional diffusion. © 2021 University of Utah.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Background: Although many studies have used audio samples to predict children's language development, they have primarily focused on the frequency of language exposure rather than complex semantic relationships and the effects of context and learner variability. Method: This study examined whether children exhibit greater syntactic development when parents engage in semantically relevant conversations during mealtime and toy play, using semantic network algorithms. Additionally, it investigated gender differences in conversational topics during toy play using topic modeling and word embedding algorithms. Data from the Home-School Study of Language and Literacy Development Corpus, focusing on a subset of 62 children, were analyzed. Results: Key findings revealed the clustering coefficient for semantic networks during mealtime was positively associated with children's syntactic development. Furthermore, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and Word2Vec algorithms showed that boys and girls had different conversational focuses during toy play, with boys gravitating toward action verbs and physical activities, and girls toward social and relational themes. Implications: These findings highlight the importance of incorporating semantically relevant conversations into daily routines to support children's syntactic development. They also emphasize the need for tailored interventions that consider context and gender differences in parent–child interactions. Future research should leverage artificial intelligence (AI)-driven language processing to refine interventions, strengthen parent engagement, and inform policies that promote equitable early language learning. Conclusion: Semantically relevant conversations during mealtime significantly enhanced children's syntactic development, and gender differences in conversational content during toy play reflected distinct linguistic focuses. This study confirms and extends existing literature, suggesting that AI-driven measures could provide a more granular and nuanced understanding of children's language learning environments. © 2025 National Council on Family Relations.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, this potential has remained largely untapped due to slow progress primarily caused by strict data access policies for researchers. In this paper, we discuss the concern for privacy and the measures it entails. We also suggest sources of less sensitive data. Finally, we draw attention to biases that can compromise the validity of empirical research and lead to socially harmful applications. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

But nowadays Sri Lankan wildlife has faced many issues because of poor management and policies to protect wildlife. The lack of technical and research support leads many researchers to retreat to select wildlife as their domain of study. This study demonstrates a novel approach to data mining to find hidden keywords and automated labeling for past research work in this area. Then use those results to predict the trending topics of researches in the field of biodiversity. To model topics and extract the main keywords, the authors used the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithms. Using the topic modeling performance, an ontology model was also developed to describe the relationships between each keyword. They classified the research papers using the artificial neural network (ANN) using ontology instances to predict the future gaps for wildlife research papers. The automatic classification and labeling will lead many researchers to find their desired research papers accurately and quickly. © 2021, IGI Global.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We identified key themes regarding integrating LLMs through qualitative data analysis of verbatim responses to an open-ended questionnaire. Reviewers noted that LLMs can automate tasks such as preliminary screening, plagiarism detection, and language verification, thereby reducing workload and enhancing consistency in applying review standards. However, significant ethical concerns were raised, including potential biases, lack of transparency, and risks to privacy and confidentiality. Reviewers emphasized that LLMs should not replace human judgment but rather complement it with human oversight, which is essential to ensure the relevance and accuracy of AI-generated feedback. This study underscores the need for clear guidelines and policies, as well as their proper dissemination among researchers, to address the ethical and practical challenges of using LLMs in academic publishing. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Although fathers are increasingly involved in family life, gender equality in both family and working life is still far from being achieved, and socially stressful situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic are exacerbating them. While the female burden of unpaid work within families has been widely studied in the literature, to date little is still known about fathers’ perception of their engagement in the family routine. Through the analysis of seven in-depth interviews of fathers with children aged 0-7, the present case-study investigates how and to what extent sharing parental responsibilities, i.e. childcare and household tasks, affects a variety of gender-equality related variables, such as the return to work of the partner, the fathers’ working career, and difficulties they have to address. By adopting text-mining analytical techniques, our findings suggest that, on the one hand, fathers’ higher family engagement facilitate and support the mothers’ returning to work; on the other hand, such commitment is recognised by fathers as slowing down their careers, especially in the case of self-employees. Broadly, whilst fathers recognise their parenting role and experience as a positive change compared to past generations, due to their family engagement they also point out how they have been victims of prejudices linked to gender stereotypes both at the workplace and among relatives or acquaintances. Importantly, the present study sheds (preliminary) light on the difficulties and obstacles experienced by fathers as a consequence of their closer engagement in family life-a rather unexplored aspect in literature so far. Indeed, if such behaviours will be sustained at a quantitative level as well, it might have important consequences for future gender-oriented strategies and policies, in terms of reshaping the productive system, overcoming gender stereotypes for both females and males, and mainstreaming approach to gender issues. © The Authors, 2021.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the experiences and responses of Canadians to these interventions on Twitter using the Kübler-Ross Change Curve (KRCC) during the first six months of the pandemic. Tweets were analyzed using sentiment analysis, thematic content analysis and KRCC. The findings highlight that many Canadians attempted to adapt to the changes but had a predominantly negative outlook on policies due to the financial and social repercussions. © 2023 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We investigate the use of a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to derive comprehensible driving decisions from multi-modal time-series data captured by a monocular camera on an autonomous vehicle. Leveraging a graph-of-thought structure, the LLM learns policies that perform robustly while generating natural language rationales. We generate a novel multi-modal dataset with sequential images, scene labels, and driving actions. Results demonstrate our method produces human-understandable explanations for its driving choices, providing transparency. Our work indicates incorporating language-based reasoning enables accountable and transparent decision-making for self-driving cars, making LLM a potential solution for autonomous driving. ©2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the substantial cost on maintaining the prolonged agent interactions poses challenge over the deployment of believable LLM-based agents. Therefore, in this paper, we develop Affordable Generative Agents (AGA), a framework for enabling the generation of believable and low-cost interactions on both agent-environment and inter-agents levels. Specifically, for agent-environment interactions, we substitute repetitive LLM inferences with learned policies; while for inter-agent interactions, we model the social relationships between agents and compress auxiliary dialogue information. Extensive experiments on multiple environments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Also, we delve into the mechanisms of emergent believable behaviors lying in LLM agents, demonstrating that agents can only generate finite behaviors in fixed environments, based upon which, we understand ways to facilitate emergent interaction behaviors.

Messages from Regional Candidates on Social Media During Election Campaigns; [(Des) conexión del discurso político con la comunicación sostenible. mensajes de los candidatos autonómicos en redes sociales en campaña electoral]\n                    ABSTRACT: The main objective of this research focuses on studying the political discourse of the 75 candidates who participated in the Spanish regional elections held on May 28, 2023, in twelve autonomous communities. The aim is to determine the possible alignment or disconnection of the political agenda of these regional candidates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the UN in the 2030 Agenda. These global goals are key elements of sustainable communication and responsible leadership, as they are focused on overcoming the multiple global challenges humanity faces today. To achieve this goal, a mixed methodology was chosen, consisting of a quantitative analysis, of a descriptive nature, and a discourse analysis – qualitative method. The FanPage Karma tool allowed monitoring a total of 190 official accounts of regional candidates on Facebook, X, Instagram, and TikTok. After eliminating duplicates and selecting only those posts that explicitly mentioned the SDGs, the sample consisted of a total of n=1,523 unique messages, which were processed with MeaningCloud for sentiment analysis. The results show that most posts focus on decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and global partnerships (SDG 17). On the other hand, hunger (SDG 2), health and well-being (SDG 3), and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) are the least visible topics. The most proactive politicians in sustainable communication were Pablo Zuloaga, the PSOE candidate for the Parliament of Cantabria, and Juan Lobato, the PSOE candidate for the Assembly of Madrid. In contrast, Leticia Díaz, Vox's candidate for the Parliament of Cantabria, and Alejandra Jacinto, Podemos' candidate for the Assembly of Madrid, were the least proactive. In conclusion, although fewer than half of the messages from regional candidates mention the 2030 Agenda, sustainable messages related to governance, transparency, or social policies generate much more engagement than those related to environmental policies. © 2024, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The public attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination process should be studied carefully in order to understand the society's opinions and concerns toward it, and to take the appropriate plans by the public health authorities accordingly. The availability of accurate information during the pandemic, its reported sources and their confidentiality play a key role on the public reported opinions toward the vaccination topic. The society used the social media extensively during the pandemic and quarantine periods to track the COVID-19 news and follow the updates of the vaccines' development process. In this study, we focused on revealing the public attitudes of the COVID-19 vaccination process on twitter as a social media platform using machine learning. The tweets are collected and preprocessed for features extraction and reduction step and the K-means clustering algorithm is used to group the vaccines related tweets in order to use the Amazon Comprehend module for sentiment analysis. Most of the reported opinions that discussed the vaccines efficiency, safety, and the governments distribution plans and the policies to secure the doses for their residents were neutral. The second largest group has negative opinions according to the inaccurate information about vaccines development process, their side effects, and unsuccessful reported trials of vaccines production during different pandemic periods. Our study highlighted the urgent need for interactive communications with the society from different cultural and educational backgrounds in order to increase the vaccination awareness and validate its related news. The deliverable speech of the health care decision makers should simplify the vaccines related scientific terms, address the community concerns, and make the vaccination distribution plans publicly available for their underlying communities. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Frequency analysis, clustering, and network analysis were performed using keywords from seven South Korean and two North Korean ICT academic journals published for five years (2015-2019). In the case of South Korea (S. Korea), the frequency of research on image processing and wireless communication was high at 16.7% and 16.3%, respectively. North Korea (N. Korea) had a high frequency of research, in the order of 18.2% for image processing, 16.9% for computer/Internet applications/security, and 16.4% for industrial technology. N. Korea’s natural language processing (NLP) sector was 11.9%, far higher than S. Korea’s 0.7 percent. Student education is a unique subject that is not clustered in S. Korea. In order to promote exchanges between the two Koreas in the ICT field, the following specific policies are proposed. Joint research will be easily possible in the image processing sector, with the highest research rate in both Koreas. Technical cooperation of medical images is required. If S. Korea’s high-quality image source is provided free of charge to N. Korea, research materials can be enriched. In the field of NLP, it calls for proposing exchanges such as holding a Korean language information conference, developing a Korean computer operating system. The field of student education encourages support for remote education contents and management know-how, as well as joint research on student remote evaluation © Jiwan Kim, Hyunkyoo Choi, Jeonghoon Mo, 2023\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Due to the importance of logistics and supply chain in the world, any disruption or mismanagement causes many problems not only in the countries directly affected but also globally. In this article, new textual data are collected from reputable commercial and news websites related to the effects of COVID-19 on logistics and supply chains. After collecting textual data, valuable information about the impact of the coronavirus is extracted using various text mining techniques performed with R programming. Finally, issues related to COVID-19 and supply chains are identified and divided into five categories: suppliers and products, governments and organisations, health, evaluation, problems, and barriers. Also, categorising the problems and limitations of supply chains and logistics will provide managerial insights to minimise obstacles and disruptions. In particular, managers should consider several suppliers to reduce dependencies and also focus on domestic suppliers because of transportation limitations. Moreover, companies should pay attention to the health of societies and employ new policies, as well as pay attention to consumer behaviour such as their tendency to buy online. © 2023 The Author(s).

With massive amount of data collected patients, personalized treatment can be provided. However, technology is a double-edge sword. Both news and media report the significant impact of security breaches, study of security is needed and as our work, life and health continually rely on more technologies, any breach or failure of the system could create disastrous impact. In this paper, we use a text analytic approach to study healthcare professionals’ view on security. Data were collected from 50 healthcare professionals with an average work experience of 17.5 years. A total of 145 posts were analyzed. The results indicate that healthcare organizations need to invest on employee training on security, developing standards in healthcare terminologies as well as security and privacy policies related to mobile and social media use. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

It is also challenging due to the strong noise generated by the news, government policies, and investor emotions. Emerging works show that the sentiment from news accumulated over weekends significantly affects stock prices. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to incorporate the sentiment from weekend news on social media to predict stock price, and then conduct a comprehensive set of popular benchmarks for comparison. Specifically, our model uses Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) and self-defined sentiment measure to extract lexical features and evaluate sentiment opinions. Then our model employs a recurrent neural network to capture potential dependency from sentiment and price-based features. Extensive experiments are implemented on stock indices and Reddit news in a high volatility period, which show that neural networks outperform all benchmarks significantly and validate the weekend effect of news on the stock market. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These models offer unprecedented potential to swiftly disseminate critical health information and transcend linguistic barriers. However, their integration into health care systems presents formidable challenges, including inherent biases in training data, privacy vulnerabilities, and disparities in digital literacy. Despite these obstacles, LLMs possess unparalleled analytic prowess to inform evidence-based health care policies and clinical practices. Addressing these challenges necessitates the formulation of robust ethical frameworks, bias mitigation strategies, and educational initiatives to ensure equitable access to health care resources globally. By navigating these complexities with meticulous attention and foresight, LLMs stand poised to catalyze substantial advancements in global health outcomes, promoting health equity and improving population health worldwide. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Existing political science research on norm diffusion, norm localization, and contestations is, however, constrained due to methodological manageability of empirical data. To face this research challenge, we propose an interdisciplinary research collaboration between political and computer science. Using the show case of energy politics, we want to conduct unsupervised and semi-supervised content analysis and fusion with the help of automated text mining methods to analyze the influence of different types of so-called norm entrepreneurs on the public acceptance and, respectively, contestations of different energy policies. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Ease of access and user friendliness make diet-tracking apps an important ally in their users’ efforts to lose and manage weight. To foster motivation for long-term use and to achieve goals, it is necessary to better understand users’ opinions and needs for dietary self-monitoring. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the key topics and issues that users highlight in their reviews of diet-tracking apps on Google Play Store. Identifying the topics that users frequently mention in their reviews of these apps, along with the user ratings for each of these apps, allowed us to identify areas where further improvement of the apps could facilitate app use, and support users’ weight loss and intake management efforts. Methods: We collected 72,084 user reviews from Google Play Store for 15 diet-tracking apps that allow users to track and count calories. After a series of text processing operations, two text-mining techniques (topic modeling and topical n-grams) were applied to the corpus of user reviews of diet-tracking apps. Results: Using the topic modeling technique, 11 separate topics were extracted from the pool of user reviews. Most of the users providing feedback were generally satisfied with the apps they use (average rating of 4.4 out of 5 for the 15 apps). Most topics referred to the positive evaluation of the apps and their functions. Negatively rated topics mostly referred to app charges and technical difficulties encountered. We identified the positive and negative topic trigrams (3-word combinations) among the most frequently mentioned topics. Usability and functionality (tracking options) of apps were rated positively on average. Negative ratings were associated with trigrams related to adding new foods, technical issues, and app charges. Conclusions: Motivating users to use an app over time could help them better achieve their nutrition goals. Although user reviews generally showed positive opinions and ratings of the apps, developers should pay more attention to users’ technical problems and inform users about expected payments, along with their refund and cancellation policies, to increase user loyalty. ©Mila Zečević, Dejan Mijatović, Mateja Kos Koklič, Vesna Žabkar, Petar Gidaković.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For these respective countries to anticipate, respond, address, and remedy these diverse needs either by using their existing resources, or by developing new policies and initiatives, or by seeking support from other countries or international organizations dedicated to global public health, the timely identification of these needs and their associated trends is highly necessary. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a study that uses the potential of the modern Internet of Everything lifestyle, where relevant Google Search data originating from different geographic regions can be interpreted to understand the underlining region-specific user interests towards a specific topic, which further demonstrates the public health need towards the same. The scientific contributions of this study are two-fold. First, it presents an open-access dataset that consists of the user interests towards fall detection for all the 193 countries of the world studied from 2004–2021. In the dataset, the user interest data is available for each month for all these countries in this time range. Second, based on the analysis of potential and emerging research directions in the interrelated fields of Big Data, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Pattern Recognition, in the context of fall detection research, this paper presents 22 research questions that may be studied, evaluated, and investigated by researchers using this dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

The anomalies detected may be due to sudden sentiment changes hidden in large amounts of text. If these anomalies are undetected or poorly managed, the consequences may be severe, e.g. A business whose customers reveal negative sentiments and will no longer support the establishment. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide a vast source of information, which includes user feedback, opinion and information on most issues. Many organizations also leverage social media platforms to publish information about events, products, services, policies and other topics frequently. Thus, analyzing social media data to identify abnormal events in a timely manner is a beneficial topic. It will enable the businesses and government organizations to intervene early or adopt proper strategies if needed. However, it is also a challenge due to the diversity and size of social media data. In this study, we survey existing anomaly analysis as well as sentiment analysis methods and analyze their limitations and challenges. To tackle the challenges, an enhanced sentiment classification method is proposed and discussed. We study the possibility of employing the proposed method to perform anomaly detection through sentiment analysis on social media data. We tested the applicability and robustness of the method through sentiment analysis on tweet data. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method and provide meaningful insights into this research area. © 2014 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study focuses on how different platforms influence user sentiment and drive engagement. We find that emotional platform (Instagram, Twitter) fulfills the social interaction needs, leading to express their engagement. Informative platforms (YouTube and TikTok) enhance fact checking and verification, thus sentiments are less associated with engagement. The empirical results find the brain drain sentiment polarity distribution also varies with the platform categories. Based on these insights, strategic recommendations are provided for Italy to leverage social media to foster positive sentiment, encourage constructive discourse, shape the engagement, and ultimately mitigate the brain drain by attracting talent back to the country. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Most research on reelection incentives compare politicians who are term-limited with those who are not. These studies concentrate mostly on relatively senior politicians in candidate-centered electoral systems. This article leverages a quasi-natural experiment posed by the staggered implementation of the 2014 Mexican Electoral Reform, which lifted an eighty-year-old ban on reelection. The author conducts a difference-in-differences analysis of the hypothesis that reelection encourages legislators to focus more on policies with the highest electoral yield-namely, particularistic legislation. Applying a correlated topic model to a new collection of transcripts from 6,890 legislative sessions in 20 Mexican states between 2012 and 2018, this article presents compelling evidence that it does, that the effect is synchronized with the electoral cycle, and that it is larger when the legislators' political horizons are longer. © \n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, while studies have shown the importance of using green spaces during the pandemic, research is lacking on their use to treat and manage depression caused by the pandemic. Methods: This study included in-depth interviews with patients with depression and the general public regarding their use of green spaces during the pandemic, which were analyzed through text mining to suggest alternatives to address the increasing number of patients with depression during the pandemic. Results: The analysis revealed that the reasons for visiting green spaces during the pandemic were activity (exercise and socialization) and nature observation (experiencing ecological scenery); patients with depression were more interested in the activity component. Conclusion: This highlights the necessity of supplementing facilities for exercise and socialization near residential areas to treat depression. Planting of landscape crops to provide landscape resources for the general public is recommended, along with policies to prevent natural damage caused by the increased number of visitors to ecological areas. © 2024 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

There is a lot of unstructured data available but this situation makes agricultural research inefficient because of its knowledge extraction and usage failure. This problem is addressed by combining an ontology framework developed for agricultural information management with Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The solution, AA-NLP, utilizes modern NLP algorithms which extract, classify and evaluate agricultural information from many textual sources that include research papers, reports and online repositories. AA-NLP achieves effective information retrieval and exploitation through named entity identification, sentiment analysis and semantic similarity as well as other techniques to convert unstructured input into structured ontological representations. Applying AA-NLP has several benefits such as increased discoverability of relevant agricultural information, automatic classification of scientific findings, and generation of actionable insights for decision making in farming practices, crop management and formulation of agricultural policies. The effectiveness of AA-NLP was analyzed in this paper by measuring the precision associated with knowledge extraction and ontology creation through various performance metrics including accuracy, sustainability farming practices, agricultural productivity and precision.  © 2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Thus, social networks end up being seen as an opportunity to bend the rules, making things inadmissible in society. This work aimed to design a dictionary template for sentiment analysis applied to unethical behaviors. It also analyses how prepared the machine is for human dialogue, and proposes a hybrid approach combining existing work for dictionary creation and standard conversation recognition in the Internet. Additionally, it also analyzes current policies to remove inappropriate content and proposes some steps to be considered to reduce spread of inappropriate content in the web. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The proposed framework aims at extracting key features of crime data available on newspaper website and classifies them into crime categories which are later transformed into a star schema for speedy retrieving and online analytical processing (OLAP). This system can present data in multidimensional structure to perform data analytics to support police officers for determining the security policies to protect locals and tourists who live in the risk areas. The main novelty of this framework is the demonstration of using information available through RSS feed service to generate reports to support decision making. The experimental results show that the extracted data from the Internet can effectively represent the actual crime data occurred in the study areas (low error rate) and allow data analysts to get an insight of the information represented through OLAP. © 2017, Walailak University.

Despite increased desalination capacity, significant sustainability concerns persist. While sustainable desalination efforts have primarily focused on improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, less attention has been paid to other environmental impacts. Moreover, questions remain about which sustainable technologies have been developed and which stakeholders’ R&D priorities. To address these gaps, we analyze patent data to trace desalination technology-development paths while examining environmental impacts and the roles of government and industry. Using bibliographical analysis, text mining, and technology life-cycle analysis, we map the evolution of the global desalination sector over the past 20 years. Our analysis reveals geographical patterns in patenting activities, including developments in core technologies such as Multiple Effect Distillation (MED), Multi-Stage Flash Distillation (MSF), and Reverse Osmosis (RO). We identify a significant misalignment between R&D pathways and broader sustainability concerns, with implications for the long-term sustainability of desalination and regional water-security policies. © 2025 The Author(s).

In this work, we looked at the development of scientific research in the field of biofuels, as a sustainable source of energy, searching for references regarding its scientific roots and social relevance. Scientific communications on biofuels published between 1998 and 2007 were analyzed using a combination of bibliometric methods and text mining techniques. This field of research was characterized as interdisciplinary, with marked social relevance. Our bibliometric analysis shows that, in this research subject, 132 different, interacting fields of knowledge overlap, with dominance of Chemistry, Engineering and Agricultural Sciences. Through the use of text mining techniques, this field was configured into three groups of Disciplinary Dimensions. The first and most influential group includes the Agricultural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Environmental Sciences. The second group, which gives the field its technological basis, includes Chemistry, Engineering, and Microbiology. The third group includes disciplines with emerging involvement in the field of biofuels: Biology and Biochemistry, Animal and Plant Sciences, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Economics, Material Sciences, Nanosciences and Nanotechnology, Geosciences, Physics, Humanities, Multidisciplinary Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Sciences. This study suggests that the first group of Disciplinary Dimensions conforms to the elements that socially validate the progress of research in the field of biofuels. This study also proposes a metric that can be used to measure the interdisciplinarity and the social framing of any other research field. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Twitter, one of the social networking sites that is expanding, serves as a platform for information, particularly in regard to ASF. Through the use of Twitter as an opinion miner, this study ascertained the attitudes of hog farmers around ASF epidemics. Using VADER Lexicon-based method as a model known for sensitivity on polarity and intensity of emotion and Orange application for ease of performing data analysis and visualization, the sentiments of the hog raisers on ASF epidemics were identified. Findings revealed that majority of hog raisers had a negative response to ASF (44.63%), 30.91% having a positive response, while 24.47% having a neutral response. Although ASF negatively affects the livelihood of hog farmers, several government actions have been put in place, and mitigation programs are currently being implemented to reduce the spread of ASF. As can be seen from the many comments offered by the sentiment analysis carried out, this is a favorable indication on the part of the government and other related agencies.

Enhanced Event Detection Accuracy: The introduction of the SemConvTree model, which integrates improved versions of BERTopic, TSB-ARTM, and SBert-Zero-Shot, enables a significant enhancement in the detection accuracy of urban events. The model’s ability to incorporate semantic analysis along with statistical evaluations allows for discerning and categorizing events from social media data more precisely. This results in approximately a 40% increase in the F1-score for event detection compared to previous methods. Semantic Analysis for Event Identification: The SemConvTree model leverages semi-supervised learning techniques to analyze the semantic content of social media posts. This approach helps in understanding the nuanced contexts of urban events, improving the identification process. The model not only recognizes the occurrence of events but also categorizes them into meaningful groups based on their semantic characteristics, which is crucial for effective urban management and planning. What are the implications of the main findings? The increased accuracy in event detection ensures that urban planners and emergency services can respond more effectively to both planned and unplanned urban events. More accurate data leads to better resource allocation, ensuring that services are deployed where they are most needed. This could lead to enhanced safety, improved traffic management, and better crowd control during events, ultimately enhancing urban living conditions. By effectively categorizing urban events based on their semantic characteristics, city administrators can gain insights into the types of events that are prevalent in different areas of the city. This can inform more targeted community engagement strategies, help in the planning of public services and facilities, and ensure that urban policies are closely aligned with the actual dynamics of the city. Additionally, this can aid in long-term urban development strategies by identifying evolving trends and shifts in urban activity patterns. The digital world is increasingly permeating our reality, creating a significant reflection of the processes and activities occurring in smart cities. Such activities include well-known urban events, celebrations, and those with a very local character. These widespread events have a significant influence on shaping the spirit and atmosphere of urban environments. This work presents SemConvTree, an enhanced semantic version of the ConvTree algorithm. It incorporates the semantic component of data through semi-supervised learning of a topic modeling ensemble, which consists of improved models: BERTopic, TSB-ARTM, and SBert-Zero-Shot. We also present an improved event search algorithm based on both statistical evaluations and semantic analysis of posts. This algorithm allows for fine-tuning the mechanism of discovering the required entities with the specified particularity (such as a particular topic). Experimental studies were conducted within the area of New York City. They showed an improvement in the detection of posts devoted to events (about 40% higher f1-score) due to the accurate handling of events of different scales. These results suggest the long-term potential for creating a semantic platform for the analysis and monitoring of urban events in the future. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to map AI-related research in libraries to identify opportunities and discuss future directions. Using textual analysis of data from Scopus, the study analyzed article titles with the burst detection algorithm and abstracts with scattertext and lemmatization. Six burst words were detected out of twelve frequently appearing in titles. Scattertext results showed a comparison between the service side (red) and the development side (blue) in libraries. Research increasingly focuses on AI utilization for library services and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance services. On the development side, AI involves product creation and encompasses AI literacy frameworks, policies, and their impact on libraries. AI affects studies in libraries by changing application methods, such as machine learning and NLP. Future research will become more diverse, considering the unique characteristics of each library. © 2025, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Therefore, the cost of online civic engagement is relatively low. The level of civic engagement of Taiwanese on Internet is twice as in the real world. On the other hand, the net opinions are also a source of public opinion for the government that should pay attention to. In addition, the social network can better reflect the opinion of people which contains a lot more valuable information. In view of this, this study uses text mining technique to analyze the contents over the online community. The above data will be combined with government open data to find out the trend of the online community and the level of concerns toward government policies. In such a way the government management team will get close to public opinions.

In this study, big data were collected and compared using NodeXL to verify differences in automotive preferences caused by differences in living standards, regional characteristics and culture, and related regulations and policies between developed and emerging countries in Asia. The data to be analyzed were collected from Twitter big data on major Asian and emerging countries and cleaned up, and text mining techniques were applied for frequency analysis. Based on this, we predicted the demand for automobiles in emerging countries in the future and derived a way for automakers to efficiently approach the automobile markets of emerging countries. The analysis results are as follows: First, emerging economies are very fond of foreign vehicles that value their confidence and pride but are more price-sensitive and prefer medium-to-small car sedans rather than SUVs. Second, pride and price should be the first marketing considerations when an automotive business enters an emerging country. Third, in emerging economies, if smalland medium-sized cars that fit lower prices are marketed mainly as sedans rather than as SUVs, local consumers will respond well. This study’s results are expected to be used as primary data for the localization sales factors necessary in understanding the car preferences of different countries for overseas marketing. © 2021\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Nevertheless, extracting potential visitors' emotional perceptions from social media and translating them into actionable recommendations for optimizing ecosystem services remains a significant challenge. The primary aim of this study is to assess and optimize the provision of ecosystem services in national parks by using social media data. A novel methodology was developed to convert unstructured social media text data into structured evaluations of ecosystem services. Moreover, by combining frequency and centrality to redefine the concept of importance, sentiment analysis was integrated to quantify visitors' emotional perceptions. Building upon this, the study introduced the Importance-performance Analysis (IPA) framework for assessing national parks ecosystem services, offering decision support for national parks planning and management. Taking Wuyishan National Park as a case study, this research demonstrated that analysis of social media text data can unveil visitors' psychological perceptions and emotional fluctuations regarding ecosystem services. Moreover, visitors exhibit diverse preferences in their perception of various ecosystem services, with Aesthetic appreciation being the most important service and inspiration, nutrient cycling, and disaster adjustment being the most satisfying. The study also revealed that the enhancement of service types such as supply of raw materials, recreation and entertainment, social inclusion, natural experiences, and sense of place and identity is urgently required. This research offers a novel perspective on the interplay between visitor perception, ecosystem services of national parks, and their management using an innovative method based on social media data. The outcomes and insights from this study can offer decision-making support for national parks policies, planning, management, as well as encourage visitor engagement in national parks development. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It also increases the risk of life-threatening conditions as well as contributes to burden on the economy in terms of the number of days lost to productivity. Loneliness is a highly varied concept though, which is a result of multiple factors. To understand loneliness this paper carries out a comparative analysis of USA and India through Twitter data on the keywords associated with loneliness. The comparative analysis on loneliness is in the vein of comparative public health literature and to contribute to develop a global public health map on loneliness. The results showed that the dynamics of loneliness through the topics correlated vary across geographical locations. Social media data can be used to capture the dynamics of loneliness which can vary from one place to another depending on the socioeconomic and cultural norms and sociopolitical policies. © 2023 The authors and IOS Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An algorithmic iterative process with N-1 steps is used to examine commuting data for the 11 subgroups and to trace LLM in both years by maximising the self-containment of jobs (number of jobs occupied by residents of the area and number of residents working in the same area) of the generated areas. Four indexes are calculated for each LLM, and the variation of these four indexes between 2001 and 2011 allows us to classify them as areas that change from areas with a surplus of jobs to deficit areas, or vice versa. The evidence indicates an increase in mobility, difference in the rates of mobility according to subgroup characteristics, and the conversion of surplus markets in employment to deficit markets. These trends give way to wider functional areas and lower levels of self-containment reflected in the length of the journey to work. This impacts quality of life, social cohesion, and the sustainability of the territories. © 2021 University of Craiova, Faculty of Social Sciences, Department of Geography.

Although the pre-trained model can conduct sentiment analysis since the beginning of a pandemic or a global emergency, this model is not optimized for a specific topic. Furthermore, the way people express opinions on the topic may quickly change during the emergency. Therefore, the early-trained model may not work consistently well during the emergency. Unfortunately, the late-trained model will not be available until months after the emergency begins. In this paper, we propose an ensemble method to combine the pre-trained model and early-trained model for achieving better analysis performance on COVID-19-related tweets. The effectiveness of this method has been verified by the experiments.  © 2020 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The noncompliance of companies with privacy policies requirements as stipulated by the various Data Protection Regulations has raised lot of concerns for users and other practitioners. To address this issue, previous research developed a model using conventional algorithms such as Neural Network (NN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to evaluate the levels of compliance of companies to general data protection regulations. However, the research performance shows to be unsatisfactory as the model’s performance across the selected core requirements of the legislation attained F1-score of between 0.52–0.71. This paper improved this model’s performance by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This was done by evaluating the same dataset used by the previous researcher to train the proposed model. The overall results show that LSTM outperform both GRU and CNN models in terms of F1-score and accuracy. This research paper is to assist the Supervisory Authority and other practitioners to better determine the state of companies’ privacy policies compliance with the relevant data protection regulations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Media framing offers interpretative package for average citizens on how to make sense of climate change and its consequences to their livelihoods, how to deal with its negative impacts, and which mitigation or adaptation policies to support. A line of related work has used bag of words and word-level features to detect frames automatically in text. Such works face limitations since standard keyword based features may not generalize well to accommodate surface variations in text when different keywords are used for similar concepts. In this paper, we develop a new type of textual features that generalize (subject,verb,object) triplets extracted from text, by clustering them into high-level concepts. We utilize these concepts as features to detect frames in text. Our corpus comprises more than 45,000 climate change related sentences. Expert coders annotated those sentences as Frame/Non-Frame and framed sentences were mapped into one of four general frame categories: Solution, problem threat, cause, and motivation. Compared to uni-gram and bi-gram based models, classification and clustering using our generalized concepts yielded better discriminating features and a higher accuracy classifier with a 12% boost (i.e. from 74% to 83% in f-measure) and 0.91 clustering purity for Frame/Non-Frame detection. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research investigates racialised narratives in online discourse following the ban's announcement. Methods: Tweets and users responding to the April 2022 menthol ban announcement were content analysed to examine the influence of tobacco industry affiliates and potentially organic African-American/Black (AA/B) users. Next we investigated the extent to which the menthol ban was discussed on AA/B subreddits and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling to provide an overview of the menthol ban discussion on Reddit. Results: Only 28 (13.9%) tweets by 22 users claimed that the menthol ban would lead to police violence and/or racial discrimination. Of users who tweeted about over-policing, eight (36.4%) had financial connections to the tobacco industry. There were only three tweets receiving a combined seven retweets from potentially organic AA/B users. On Reddit, only two posts with one comment discussed the menthol ban on subreddits dedicated to AA/B issues and culture. Topic modelling showed that the most common topic related to the menthol ban involved the social and political implications of the ban followed by illicit markets and protecting youth. Conclusion: Tweets claiming a menthol ban will lead to police violence are indicative of industry agenda-setting. The menthol ban was not a prominent topic of discussion in AA/B subreddits although users discussing news and politics expressed concern for how AA/B people would respond to a ban politically.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

To do so, we focus on the publications of two key entities in the defense of “parental pin” in Spain: Profesionales por la Ética and Educadores contra el Adoctrinamiento. The information is collected from data mining and participant observation techniques. The analysis presents both a quantitative approach to frequencies and references, and a qualitative treatment in the form of sentiment analysis. The data show that the discourse focuses on the defense of the freedom of families to decide on the education of their children, and on the opposition to sex education as a curricular element. For this purpose, a direct attack is carried out towards the LGTBI+ collective, certain political representatives linked to the left and the public system, with a focus on the educational network, including schools and teachers. The analysis also shows the conflict between this narrative and the right to education and freedom of education, and how it has become a weapon of political and partisan pressure. Conclusions are presented and those findings are discussed with other studies in relation to hate speech and the political strategies of the extreme right and ultra-Catholicism with which our data show agreement. Finally, limitations and future proposals are pointed out. © 2024 Scientific Association Icono14.

This study was conducted to analyze the discourse on sustainable body image in Korean society. User-generated content from 1 January 2014 to 31 July 2023 underwent data refinement and term frequency (TF), TF–inverse document frequency (TF–IDF), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analyses. The number of blog posts in 2020 was nearly triple the number in 2019. Thus, the analysis period was divided into first (from 2014 to 2019) and second (from 2020 to 31 July 2023) periods. The TF–IDF analysis showed that shooting, photo, diet, exercise, goal, and challenge were among the top words in the first period, while Instagram-related words were mosr frequent in the second period. This finding suggested that social distancing policies significantly affected social media usage. The LDA analysis revealed five topics that were common in the first and second periods and three topics that emerged in the second period. Overall, while Western societies tend to idealize specific body types, body image discourse in Korea is centered around exercise as a means to achieve “photography” or “photo shoot”-related goals. Exercise is perceived as an activity performed for pleasure rather than attaining a particular body shape. Furthermore, there is a desire to document one’s body beautifully and maintain exercise habits in the long run. The results of this study could serve as foundational material for establishing and sustaining a positive body image culture. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, existing tuning techniques fall short because of the high computation and memory overhead. To this end, we introduce a computation- and memory-efficient LLM tuning framework, called Edge-LLM, to facilitate affordable and effective LLM adaptation on edge devices. Specifically, Edge-LLM features three core components: (1) a layer-wise unified compression (LUC) technique to reduce the computation overhead by generating layer-wise pruning sparsity and quantization bit-width policies, (2) an adaptive layer tuning and voting scheme to reduce the memory overhead by reducing the backpropagation depth, and (3) a complementary hardware scheduling strategy to handle the irregular computation patterns introduced by LUC and adaptive layer tuning, thereby achieving improved real hardware efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Edge-LLM achieves on-device adaptation with comparable task accuracy as vanilla tuning methods with a 2.92× speed up and a 4× reduction in memory overhead.

Traditional manual data collection methods from retail sources are labor-intensive and fraught with issues of scalability, accuracy, and data diversity. Our study introduces an OWL RDFS-based framework aligned with COICOP, and a transformer model,’PRICER’, to automate the extraction and structuring of online retail data into RDF. By iteratively fine-tuning PRICER—first with a broad DBPedia and Wikipedia knowledge base, then with specific online retail data—we achieve significant efficiency and accuracy improvements in data collection. Notably, PRICER shows marked performance gains in precision and recall after task-specific conditioning, validating our approach for converting unstructured text to structured knowledge. This advancement facilitates streamlined economic data aggregation and highlights PRICER’s adaptability for broader standardised data processing applications. Future work will focus scaling the domain specific price dataset, refining the model’s conditioning and exploring potential for other forms of technical data. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This study aims to analyse the intellectual structure of academic literature on the SDGs, Innovation, and Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). Using a database of 544 English-language publications from Scopus and Web of Science published between 2015 and 2023, we employ a three-pronged approach comprising bibliometric analyses, SDG mapping and text-mining techniques. Our findings indicate that innovations in one cluster defined in the analysis display economic, social and environmental dimensions. Furthermore, the underlying roles of innovation in the literature are found to relate to promoting sustainable development, driving economic growth, enhancing enterprise performance and strengthening policies. Within the sample literature, all 17 goals were identified by the SDG Mapper. Among the 5Ps (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnerships), there was a clear preponderance of articles on Prosperity. The text mining of titles and abstracts indicates that the term “sti” is less commonly associated with the SGDs than “innovation”. However, there is some evidence that the term “innovation” is used in titles and abstracts to attract a broader audience. Our study highlights research gaps and identifies opportunities for future studies. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In response, the Korean Epilepsy Society initiated the Epilepsy Renaming project in 2008 to replace the stigmatizing term with a neutral and scientifically grounded name, “cerebroelectric disorder”. This study explores the impact of changing terminology on the public discourse surrounding epilepsy. Methods: Online news articles from distinct time periods (2001–2003, 2011–2014, 2017–2018, and 2020–2022) were analyzed using text data analysis techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, frequency analysis, and sentiment analysis. The inclusion of data from 2017 to 2018 allowed for an examination of discourse trends independent of the COVID-19 pandemic's influence. Correlation of words in each period was visualized via network maps. Migraine was set as control term to highlight changes in perception devoid of significant stigma intervention efforts. Results: The analysis revealed a significant shift in terminology preference, with cerebroelectric disorder gradually replacing epilepsy in news articles. The discourse surrounding epilepsy evolved over time from focusing on healthcare and economic aspects to patient-centered discussions, emphasizing the daily lives of individuals with epilepsy. This shift towards more empathetic and less stigmatized language was contrasted against the discourse on migraine, highlighting the specific impact of the terminological change on epilepsy's perception. Conclusion: The adoption of the neutral term “cerebroelectric disorder” in South Korea has influenced the discourse surrounding epilepsy, leading to more patient-centered discussions and a reduction in stigma. This study highlights the importance of terminology in shaping public perceptions of diseases and suggests that changing terminology can positively impact the understanding and destigmatization of epilepsy. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While the amount of food data increases, many important topics have been studied within separate fields or too narrow disciplines, due to the interdisciplinary nature of this type of data. The author is of the opinion that these drawbacks can be eliminated by analysing food big data using computing methods and by taking interdisciplinary approach to develop research questions. The fact that computer science has a significant role in the analysis of food consumption data is evidenced by the development of a new field of science—food computing, which is the framework of this study. Since there are still many unresolved tasks in the collection and analysis of food-related data, the use of social media and other type of big data is an important introduction. The author, by combining the methodological frameworks of cognitive, social and computer sciences, has developed several methods for using big data, based on the natural language processing and by applying the following methodologies: a) sentiment analysis of affective reactions about food and multi-sensory eating experience; b) comparative analysis of different national cuisines, by applying the topic modelling methodology; and c) bigram analysis to trace ways how food consumers talk about healthy food. Results have been summarised in a new conceptual framework by illustrating its application in practice; in the course of application, several researches, have been conducted using various computer science methodologies. As a combination of theories and methodologies of social, cognitive, and computer sciences, the new conceptual framework offers methods and a direction for studying food consumers. By using computer science methods in the analysis of big data and thus improving the understanding of food consumption, the author hopes to improve the efficiency of public health policies resulting in better public health and higher quality of life. © 2024 University of Latvia.

In this context, this study aims to analyze the similarity of syphilis online news to comprehend how public health communication interventions influence media coverage of the syphilis issue. Methods: This paper presented a computational approach to assess the effectiveness of communication actions on a public health problem. Data were collected between January 2015 and December 2019 and processed using the Hermes ecosystem, which utilizes text mining and machine learning algorithms to cluster similar content. Results: Hermes identified 1049 google-indexed web pages containing the term ’syphilis’ in Brazil. Of these, 619 were categorized as news stories. In total, 157 were grouped into clusters of at least two similar news items and a single cluster with 462 news classified as “single” for not featuring similar news items. From these, 19 clusters were identified in the pre-campaign period, 23 during the campaign, and 115 in the post-campaign. Conclusions: The findings presented in this study show that the volume of syphilis-related news reports has increased in recent years and gained popularity after the SNP started, having been boosted during the campaign and escalating even after its completion. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study uses a topic modeling algorithm with a text embedding technique to classify the road rage by characteristics (i.e., type, behavior, damage, punishment, and context). We collected 39 representative cases of the road rage from precedent data in Korea. We used nominalizing keywords and a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm of topic modeling among text mining techniques to analyze each case's criminal facts and punishment. After preprocessing by indexing with a coherence score, we set the appropriate number of topics. Through the study, it was confirmed that the model has the highest explanatory power with five topics. We further analyze the five topics for occurrence and subsequent road rage, method of realizing road rage, psychological state of the offenders during road rage, method of collecting evidence of road rage, and type and extent of the damage. By categorizing the keywords, we derive the road rage cases by type. Through this study, precedents dealing with criminal cases of road rage were analyzed to derive the types and causes of retaliatory driving. This result is expected to be used as basic data for the enactment of road rage policies and laws in the future. © 2022 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While there exist methods for hate speech detection, they stereotype words and hence suffer from inherently biased training. Bias removal has been traditionally studied for structured datasets, but we aim at bias mitigation from unstructured text data. In this paper, we make two important contributions. First, we systematically design methods to quantify the bias for any model and propose algorithms for identifying the set of words which the model stereotypes. Second, we propose novel methods leveraging knowledge-based generalizations for bias-free learning. Knowledge-based generalization provides an effective way to encode knowledge because the abstraction they provide not only generalizes content but also facilitates retraction of information from the hate speech detection classifier, thereby reducing the imbalance. We experiment with multiple knowledge generalization policies and analyze their effect on general performance and in mitigating bias. Our experiments with two real-world datasets, a Wikipedia Talk Pages dataset (WikiDetox) of size ∼96k and a Twitter dataset of size ∼24k, show that the use of knowledge-based generalizations results in better performance by forcing the classifier to learn from generalized content. Our methods utilize existing knowledge-bases and can easily be extended to other tasks. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We first construct a monthly-frequency measure of regulatory uncertainty related to oil and gas production using natural language processing on over 600,000 U.S. newspaper articles published from 1985 to 2021. We then conduct empirical analysis via structural VAR models with the constructed oil regulatory uncertainty index, oil market variables, and aggregate economic data. The impulse response functions suggest that an increase in oil regulatory uncertainty reduces oil production and drilling activity and negatively affects national and state-level economic outcomes. © 2025 Western Economic Association International.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Objectives We used unsupervised machine learning to identify and characterise sale offers of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and associated products on Instagram. We examined types of sellers, geographic ENDS location and use of age verification. Methods Our methodology was composed of three phases: data collection, topic modelling and content analysis. We used data mining approaches to query hashtags related to ENDS product use among young adults to collect Instagram posts. For topic modelling, we applied an unsupervised machine learning approach to thematically categorise and identify topic clusters associated with selling activity. Content analysis was then used to characterise offers for sale of ENDS products. Results From 70 725 posts, we identified 3331 engaged in sale of ENDS products. Posts originated from 20 different countries and were roughly split between individual (46.3%) and retail sellers (43.4%), with linked online sellers (8.8%) representing a smaller volume. ENDS products most frequently offered for sale were flavoured e-liquids (53.0%) and vaping devices (20.5%). Online sellers offering flavoured e-liquids were less likely to use age verification at point of purchase (29% vs 64%) compared with other products. Conclusions Instagram is a global venue for unregulated ENDS sales, including flavoured products, and access to websites lacking age verification. Such posts may violate Instagram’s policies and US federal and state law, necessitating more robust review and enforcement to prevent ENDS uptake and access. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

This work presents an analysis of social media comments data given in response to posts around the connection to the grid of a nuclear plant reactor in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We assessed comments on Facebook posts of local and international media, as well those written in response to a post of a social media influencer. We extracted the main themes and performed sentiment analysis. The results indicate the presence of mixed views towards nuclear energy when focusing on comments on international media’s posts as well as on the social media influencer’s post considered, whilst they were very positive when assessing comments to local media. All in all, nuclear waste and previous nuclear accidents appear to be as the top of the mind; at the same time, solar energy is often suggested in the comments as a viable energy source for the UAE. Implications for the communication of nuclear energy developments in social media are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Many practical issues and potential risks arise during the manual audit process, including a low level of efficiency, accuracy, accountability, high expense and its laborious and time consuming nature. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a continuous compliance awareness framework (CoCAF). It is defined as an AI-based automated approach to conduct procurement compliance auditing. CoCAF is used to automatically and timely audit an organisation’s purchases by intelligently understanding compliance policies and extracting the required information from purchasing evidence using text extraction technologies, automatic processing methods and a report rating system. Based on the auditing results, the CoCAF can provide a continuously updated report demonstrating the compliance level of the procurement with statistics and diagrams. The CoCAF is evaluated on a real-life procurement data set, and results show that it can process 500 purchasing pieces of evidence within five minutes and provide 95.6% auditing accuracy, demonstrating its high efficiency, quality and assurance level in procurement internal audit. © 2020 by the authors.

The Pre-Employment Cards (Kartu Prakerja) is one of the government programs that aims to provide assistance to the Indonesian people, especially those who do not have a job. Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency for 2020-2021 recipients of the pre-employment program as many as 11.4 million recipients, the pre-employment card program received responses from various communities, whether recipients or not, where these opinions included pro-contra opinions on the Pre-Employment Cards (Kartu Prakerja) program. The purpose of this study is to classify the response (sentiment) of the community by using machine learning on pre-employment cards. Sentiment analysis is used to obtain information in the form of opinions (sentiments) based on textual data to determine the public's view of news, service satisfaction, and government policies. The sentiment analysis process is divided into several stages, namely: crawling, data preprocessing, classification, and data visualization. In this study, preprocessing consists of several stages, namely: cleaning, lemmization, stemming, tokenizing, and stopword removal. The method used in this research is a combination of unsupervised learning: Lexicon Based and supervised learning: Support Vector Machine. Textual data weighting is based on data matching against the normalized Lexicon Sentiment with scaling to determine the positive, neutral, and negative sentiment classes. The results of the classification of 940 tweet data obtained 330 positive tweets (35%), 302 negative tweets (32%), and 308 neutral tweets (33%). From the test results on the classification accuracy with the Support Vector Machine, the results obtained an average accuracy of 98.75%, precision 0.98, recall 0.98, and f-measure 0.98 with the conditions for selecting the Cost value in SVM using the help of 10-fold cross validation.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper analyzes the policies governing national and regional artificial intelligence infrastructures to advance an understanding of entangled narrativesin global affairs. It does so by utilizing artificial intelligence techniques that assist with generalizability and model building without sacrificing granularity. In particular, the machine learning and natural language processing big data models used alongside some process-tracing demonstrate the ways artificial intelligence infrastructural plans diverge, cluster, and transform along several topical dimensions in comparative contexts. The paper's entangled narrative approach adds to international relations (IR) theorizing about infrastructural narratives and technological diffusion. We provide patterned and granular results at various levels, which challenge and refine existing theories that attribute differences in infrastructures and technological adoption to geopolitical competition and imitation, top-down or linear international diffusion effects, and differences in political systems.  © 2025 The Author(s) (2025).

However, the heterogeneity of the constituent layers of IoT makes it vulnerable to multiple security threats. One of the typical vulnerability of IoT involves the endpoint, i.e. the apps that are used by end users for enabling IoT services. Generally, the users have to authorize the app, during installation time, to perform certain tasks. Often the apps ask for permissions to access information which are not related to the IoT services provided by them. These over-privileged apps have the chance to turn malicious at any moment and use such information for their benefit. Sometimes, the users are naive enough to trust the apps and grant permissions without caution, thus leading to unintended exposure of personal information to malicious apps. It is important to analyze the app description for understanding the exact meaning of a stated functionality in the app description. In this paper, we have focused on the use of NLP in securing user data from malicious IoT apps by analysing their privacy policies and user reviews. This is followed by a novel proposal that supports cautious decision making of users based on a careful analysis of app behaviour. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Our goal in this paper is to first analyse how sustainability is addressed at the French bachelor level; then we provide a pluralistic approach to sustainability, upon which an ambitiously effective curriculum can be built. The question is not to present a course framework - that is the professor's responsibility, but to show how pluralism can combine rigour with critical thinking within the context of sustainability.

The tweets featured information on the most common immunizations has recently been available all around the world. The method of natural language processing is the successful tool to investigate the reactions of the people to various immunizations. This paper proposes a ensemble learning model making use of the VADER lexicon, logistic regression, and random forest algorithm for sentiment analysis to understand and interpret the people's sentiments through the tweets. We utilize a collection of tweets in April to May 2021 to extract inferences about public views on vaccinations as they become more widely available during the COVID-19 pandemic. The classification output of the VADER algorithm is used as one more feature that helps to achieve better accuracy using the random forest algorithm. One more feature is added with the available features using logistic regression. Hence, the classification outputs of VADER and logistic regression improve the classification accuracy to 88% for positive-negative outputs and 84% for positive, neutral, and negative outputs.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Even world leaders need the data to make analyses and make better policies for people. In almost every field where the work process is digitized need to store data and then retrieve it. According to statistics most of the data is stored in the relational database and for manipulations of the data, Structured Query Language(SQL) is commonly used. So for handling databases a person need to have specialized knowledge regarding the queries and had to remember the syntax of many complex queries. So to enhance data manipulation using SQL and to efficiently get the required query, the paper proposes a method for the generation of SQL query from natural language input, spoken(audio input) by the user. The model is constructed on NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Neural Networks (Deep Learning) technologies. Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) Model is used for predicting queries and is trained on the dataset with natural language as input and returns outline skeletal structure of the query as output. Then the output will be processed and the final query will be displayed to the user. The project also aims to benefit the people who are suffering from Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI), causing pain in the finger joints, which has been attributed to work requiring a long period of typing and also to those who are not familiar with SQL queries. As this system will readily provide the required query. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The increasing moral consciousness of stakeholders has put pressure on companies, forcing these companies to include long-term policies that reflect the regionally specific needs of stakeholders. Using a structural topic model, this study identified differences between developing and developed countries with respect to sustainability disclosures. Data were obtained from 2100 sustainability reports published in the United Nations Global Compact database for the year 2020. In global terms, these sustainability reports addressed three main topics: 1) human rights, 2) diversity, equity, and inclusion, and 3) sustainable production. Moreover, the sustainability reports from developing and developed countries incorporated different communication strategies. Based on the prevalence (rate of occurrence) of content, sustainability reports from developed countries predominantly communicated issues related to “sustainable production” and “supply chain emissions”, whereas sustainability reports from developing countries more frequently communicated issues related to “education” and “human rights.

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

LLMs, pre-trained on vast text datasets, have exhibited exceptional abilities in understanding natural language and planning tasks. These abilities of LLMs are promising in robotics. In general, traditional supervised learning-based robot intelligence systems have a significant lack of adaptability to dynamically changing environments. However, LLMs help a robot intelligence system to improve its generalization ability in dynamic and complex real-world environments. Indeed, findings from ongoing robotics studies indicate that LLMs can significantly improve robots’ behavior planning and execution capabilities. Additionally, vision-language models (VLMs), trained on extensive visual and linguistic data for the vision question answering (VQA) problem, excel at integrating computer vision with natural language processing. VLMs can comprehend visual contexts and execute actions through natural language. They also provide descriptions of scenes in natural language. Several studies have explored the enhancement of robot intelligence using multimodal data, including object recognition and description by VLMs, along with the execution of language-driven commands integrated with visual information. This review paper thoroughly investigates how foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs have been employed to boost robot intelligence. For clarity, the research areas are categorized into five topics: reward design in reinforcement learning, low-level control, high-level planning, manipulation, and scene understanding. This review also summarizes studies that show how foundation models, such as the Eureka model for automating reward function design in reinforcement learning, RT-2 for integrating visual data, language, and robot actions in vision-language-action models, and AutoRT for generating feasible tasks and executing robot behavior policies via LLMs, have improved robot intelligence. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The data originate from the 1970s and are stored in archives from the UK and US governments, plus the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The overarching theme is to analyse the involvement of the UK, the USA, and the UNHCR in different refugee cases that occurred during the 1970s. To do so, we (1) identify the main topics in each document; (2) investigate the transmission of topics horizontally (between organizations) and vertically (through time); and (3) suggest targeted areas of the document set for further close reading by historians. Standard Optical Character Recognition and object detection are used to extract information from documents and categorize them. Then, natural language processing (NLP) methods like topic modelling and clustering are used to identify topics and the relationships between them across time. The results identify several main themes covered by different organizations and how the focus of each organization changes diachronically. Besides its academic contribution, this study also demonstrates how, through the use of existing techniques with limited customization, digital technologies in the hands of the historian can augment and complement qualitative methods in bringing to light the themes and trends demonstrated in large bodies of historical documents.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The privacy policies of online websites, which serve as a legal agreement between service providers and users, are not easy for people to understand and therefore offer an opportunity for natural language processing. In this paper, we consider a corpus of these policies, and tackle the problem of aligning or grouping segments of policies based on the privacy issues they address. A dataset of pairwise judgments from humans is used to evaluate two methods, one based on clustering and another based on a hidden Markov model. Our analysis suggests a five-point gap between system and median-human levels of agreement with a consensus annotation, of which half can be closed with bag of words representations and half requires more sophistication.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Traditional studies including theoretical model-based, empirical study-based and simulation-based methods encounter limitations due to the idealized assumption of complete information and individual rationality, as well as constraints posed by limited available data. In this work, we propose an innovative framework, SRAP-Agent (Simulating and Optimizing Scarce Resource Allocation Policy with LLM-based Agent), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into economic simulations, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world dynamics. Using public housing allocation scenarios as a case study, we conduct extensive policy simulation experiments to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the SRAP-Agent and employ the Policy Optimization Algorithm with certain optimization objectives.

This has led to a debate in recent years, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. This research aims to analyze the two sentiments of the public regarding the vaccination policy. This would be helpful to ensure the acceptance of the government campaign about vaccination. The data used was text data obtained from Twitter when Indonesia was facing the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The data were pre-processed by removing noise data, case folding, stemming, and tokenizing. Then, the data were classified with random forest, Naïve Bayes, and XGBoost. The results showed that all classifiers exhibit satisfying performance but XGBoost performs slightly better in accuracy value. This method can be deployed to be an automatic sentiment analyzer to help the government understand public feedback about its policies. This would be given by proper pre-processing and enough datasets. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Recent research has proposed the use of a large language model (LLM) to generate reward functions in reinforcement learning, thereby replacing the need for manually designed rewards by experts. However, this approach, which relies on textual descriptions to define learning objectives, fails to achieve controllable and precise behavior learning with clear directionality. In this paper, we introduce a new video2reward method, which directly generates reward functions from videos depicting the behaviors to be mimicked and learned. Specifically, we first process videos containing the target behaviors, converting the motion information of individuals in the videos into keypoint trajectories represented as coordinates through a video2text transforming module. These trajectories are then fed into an LLM to generate the reward function, which in turn is used to train the policy. To enhance the quality of the reward function, we develop a video-assisted iterative reward refinement scheme that visually assesses the learned behaviors and provides textual feedback to the LLM. This feedback guides the LLM to continually refine the reward function, ultimately facilitating more efficient behavior learning. Experimental results on tasks involving bipedal and quadrupedal robot motion control demonstrate that our method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art LLM-based reward generation methods by over 37.6% in terms of human normalized score. More importantly, by switching video inputs, we find our method can rapidly learn diverse motion behaviors such as walking and running. © 2024 The Authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Accordingly, we collected and analyzed 2230 policy documents spanning 25 years to track the Chinese government’s focus on the electric power sector over time using latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling. Our results reveal that the government’s area of emphasis differs across different stages of development. By analyzing the evolution of policy implementation, we identified the actions taken by government agencies at the policy level to promote the electric power industry. We then distilled the key themes of government attention and challenges facing the green transition of electricity in the context of “dual carbon”. Based on this analysis, we propose practical recommendations for restructuring power energy, enhancing power security, and improving power market efficiency. These findings hold important implications for China to achieve an environmentally sustainable electric power transformation. © 2023 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Some districts that have catered to tourism and commercial real estate have undergone architectural and lifestyle changes, thus resulting in the loss of folk culture. Additionally, as a result of funding shortages or property disputes, other districts appear to have decayed but have regained attention, as the collective memory of these districts is valued. This paper uses Shiqiao Town in Chengdu, China, as a case study to explore the redevelopment of historic districts, with a focus on preserving and revitalising collective memory during urban expansion. Via participant observations, semistructured interviews, netnography, natural language processing, and policy content reviews, this paper investigated collective memories based on the everyday lives and public perceptions of residents, with the aim of facilitating interactions between social groups, historic districts, and the city. Unlike previous practices related to creative destruction, current redevelopment practices offer opportunities for physical preservation and the representation of collective memory, thereby attaining a mutually beneficial outcome for both economic development and heritage conservation. The goal of this initiative is to promote the continuous reconstruction of collective memory, thus forming a redevelopment framework focused on ‘Original Memories’, ‘Stable Linkages’, and ‘Continuous Reconstruction’. This study also highlights potential issues in delayed redevelopment, such as authenticity, accuracy of cultural promotion, and resident participation, thereby offering insights for future development and similar historic districts. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The reason is its limitations in adapting the dynamically changing information of users, tasks, access policies and resources in such applications. It also does not incorporate semantically meaningful business roles, which could have a diverse impact upon access decisions in such multi-domain collaborative business environments. We propose an Intelligent Role-based Access Control (I-RBAC) model that uses intelligent software agents for achieving intelligent access control in such highly dynamic multi-domain environments. The novelty of this model lies in using a core I-RBAC ontology that is developed using real-world semantic business roles as occupational roles provided by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), USA. It contains around 1400 business roles, from nearly all domains, along with their detailed task descriptions as well as hierarchical relationships among them. The semantic role mining process is performed through intelligent agents that use word embedding and a bidirectional LSTM deep neural network for automated population of organizational ontology from its unstructured text policy and, subsequently, matching this ontology with core I-RBAC ontology to extract unified business roles. The experimentation was performed on a large number of collaboration case scenarios of five multi-domain organizations and promising results were obtained regarding the accuracy of automatically derived RDF triples (Subject, Predicate, Object) from organizational text policies as well as the accuracy of extracted semantically meaningful roles. © 2021 by the authors.

It represents the collective opinion and prevalent views about a certain topic, policy, or issue. Extreme public opinion consists of extreme views held by individuals that advocate and spread radical ideas for the purpose of radicalizing others. while the proliferation of social media gives unprecedented reach and visibility and a platform for freely expressing public opinion, social media fora can also be used for spreading extreme views, manipulating public opinions, and radicalizing others. In this work, we leverage data mining and analytics techniques to study extreme public opinion expressed using social medial. A dataset of 259, 904 tweets posted between 21/02/2016 and 01/05/2021 was collected in relation to extreme nationalism, hate speech, and supremacy. The collected data was analyzed using a variety to techniques, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, social circle analysis, and opinion leaders' identification, and results related to an American politician and an American right-wing activist were presented. The results obtained are very promising and open the door to the ability to monitor the evolution of extreme views and public opinion online. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

One application has several reviews from positive and negative users. Review data can be labeled with two types of emotions: negative sentiment and positive sentiment. Fine-grained sentiment analysis is a type of sentiment analysis that can be used to identify user reactions. One method of sentiment analysis is Multinomial Naïve Bayes. In this research, we used Multinomial Naïve Bayes to perform fine-grained sentiment analysis for users of the PeduliLindungi application. The data used is from the Google Play store. The sentiment class labeling results for the PeduliLindungi review data resulted in 9021 reviews, including a total of 6244 negative reviews and 2777 positive reviews. This research uses a data-sharing model that divides 80% of training data and 20% of test data. Many data imbalances for the two sentiment classes can be overcome by using the SMOTE method. SMOTE has been shown to improve classification accuracy more effectively than non-SMOTE, as applying SMOTE has been shown to improve the performance of imbalanced data. The proper classification method used to classify PeduliLindungi's user ratings is Multinomial Naïve Bayes-SMOTE, which has the highest AUC value.  © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science (IAES).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, using natural language processing techniques in data science domain, we analyzed twitter micro-blogging streams to detect emotions and sentiments that surround the Global youth Climate Protest (GloClimePro) with respect to #ThisIsZeroHour, #ClimateJustice and #WeDontHaveTime hashtags. The analysis follows tweet scrapping, cleaning and preprocessing, extraction of GloClimePro-related items, sentiment analysis, emotion classification, and visualization. The results obtained reveal that most people expressed joy, anticipation and trust emotions in the #ThisIsZeroHour and #ClimateJustice action than the few who expressed disgust, sadness and surprise. #ClimateJustice conveys the most positive sentiments, followed by #ThisIsZeroHour and the #WeDontHaveTime. In all the evaluations, a considerable number of people express fear in the climate action and consequences. Thus, climate change stakeholders and policy makers should consider the sentiments and emotions expressed by people and incorporate such outcomes in their various programmes toward addressing the climate change challenges especially as it affects the ecosystem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

CiteOpinion uses a deep learning model to automatically extract citing sentences from representative citing papers; it starts with an analysis on the citing sentences, then it identifies major academic contribution points of the cited paper, positive/negative evaluations from citing authors and the changes in the subjects of subsequent citing authors by means of Recognizing Categories of Moves (problems, methods, conclusions, etc.), and sentiment analysis and topic clustering. Citing sentences in a citing paper contain substantial evidences useful for academic evaluation. They can also be used to objectively and authentically reveal the nature and degree of contribution of the cited paper reflected by citation, beyond simple citation statistics. The evidence-based evaluation tool CiteOpinion can provide an objective and in-depth academic value evaluation basis for the representative papers of scientific researchers, research teams, and institutions. No other similar practical tool is found in papers retrieved. There are difficulties in acquiring full text of citing papers. There is a need to refine the calculation based on the sentiment scores of citing sentences. Currently, the tool is only used for academic contribution evaluation, while its value in policy studies, technical application, and promotion of science is not yet tested. © 2019 2019 Xiaoqiu Le, Jingdan Chu, Siyi Deng, Qihang Jiao, Jingjing Pei, Liya Zhu, Junliang Yao, published by Sciendo.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, it is unclear if the public shares these concerns. This study aimed to describe posts related to gabapentinoids, conduct a content analysis to identify common themes and describe adverse events or symptoms. Methods: Keywords of ‘pregabalin’ or ‘Lyrica’ or ‘gabapentin’ or ‘Neurontin’ were used to search for related tweets posted by people in the community between 8 March and 7 May 2021. Eligible tweets included a keyword in the post. We extracted de-identified data which included descriptive data of the total number of posts over time; and data on individual tweets including date, number of re-tweets and post content. Data were exported separately for pregabalin- and gabapentin-related tweets. A 20% random sample was used for the thematic analysis. Results: There were 2931 pregabalin-related tweets and 2736 gabapentin-related tweets. Thematic analysis revealed three themes (sharing positive experiences and benefits of taking gabapentinoids, people voicing their negative experiences, and people seeking opinions and sharing information). Positive experiences of gabapentinoids were related to sharing stories and giving advice. This was contrasted to negative experiences including ineffectiveness, withdrawals, side effects and frustration related to cost and insurance coverage. Brain fog was the most common adverse symptom reported. Gabapentinoid-related deaths were only mentioned in three tweets. Discussion: The increasing public health concern of gabapentinoid-related deaths was not translated to Twitter discussions. © 2022 The Authors.

We consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings-offline, online, and hybrid-and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees. Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.

This study uses text mining and machine learning methods for automatically identify and classify the topics that permeate a collection of documents. The topics of SSC research were identified, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, from 684 articles published between 2001 and 2017 in 13 top journals. Then, we explored trends by examining changes in the classification of topics in different periods and by identifying the hot and cold topics of SSC research. The relationships of these topics with the journals were also determined. Finally, applying the Competitive Neural Network learning model, the topics were classified according to the Elkington's Triple Bottom Line precepts. The findings of this study are expected to provide clues for researchers and policymakers in the field of SSC. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Key topics included alumni engagement, and the relatively low number of trainees interested in an academic career path. Dr. Dawn Beraud, the Executive Director of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) emphasized the importance of science advocacy, including increasing science funding and linking evidence-based decision making to policy. Discussions about graduate education highlighted best practices in using large language models, financial support challenges, and the significant role of industrial professionals in teaching. The proposed NextProf PharmSci program was discussed, which aims to address the imbalance of trainees leaning towards industry by preparing them for academic roles through a multi-day workshop. Participants expressed strong support for this initiative, emphasizing the need for a training pipeline and mentoring junior faculty. Participants agreed the event should be held annually, as it was found to be useful, and discussed future topics including sharing graduate and PharmD curricula as well as a shared summer school program. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To explain this puzzle, the article advances propositions regarding the role of multidimensional policy ideas, policy anomalies and institutional gatekeepers in legislative agenda-setting. Using structural topic modelling and qualitative methods, the analyses demonstrate that differences in action frames follow from agenda-setting institutions. The corporate structure of the European Commission ensures that EU agenda-setters are reasonably attentive to policy anomalies. By contrast, individuals with agenda-setting authority in the US Congress are liable to discount anomalies by limiting their focus to certain aspects of multidimensional policy issues. Moreover, individuals with gatekeeping authority may prevent repeal bills from accessing the legislative agenda. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While most studies focus on the design and development of chatbots, there exists a very scarce literature on the effect of ChatGPT chatbot on students’ achievement. To address this gap, this study checked the effect of ChatGPT chatbot on computer education students. Using a repeated measures approach, 68 year one undergraduates participated in the study. A 50-item Computer Education Achievement Test (CEAT), which was subjected to expert validation and pilot study, was used to obtain data. The students were given two pre-test and posttest measures before and after the treatment. Data were computed using mixed design repeated measures analysis of variance and the findings revealed that the use of ChatGPT chatbot improved students’ performance (F (3,201) = 408.793, P = 0.000) with an effect size (ηp2) of 0.859. The finding also revealed no significant moderating influence of gender, age and experience on the effect of ChatGPT chatbot on students’ performance. The study has some implication for lecturers, researchers and policy experts on the need to incorporate ChatGPT chatbot in education given that it has the potential to improve students’ performance and equally promote self-paced individualized learning. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While previous research has primarily considered how authoritarian regimes disseminate CTs for political purposes and has often viewed the public as fully receptive to propaganda and easily manipulated, our research explores a broader spectrum of state strategies including propagation, tolerance, and partial rebuttal. Based on social network analysis, topic modeling, and qualitative analysis of 46,387 Weibo posts from 3 cases, we argue that the Chinese government’s manipulation of CTs is multifaceted and carries significant audience costs. Our findings indicate that state-led CTs can indeed mobilize public opinion, but they also risk expanding beyond state control, which can lead to unintended consequences that may undermine state interests and limit policy flexibility. This research contributes to our understanding of the tactical and operational complexities authoritarian regimes face when leveraging CTs, while highlighting the intricate balance between state control and public agency. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We propose a novel taxonomy of three main classes based on the way that the two model types interact with each other. The first class, RL4LLM, includes studies where RL is leveraged to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). RL4LLM is divided into two sub-categories depending on whether RL is used to directly fine-tune an existing LLM or to improve the prompt of the LLM. In the second class, LLM4RL, an LLM assists the training of an RL model that performs a task that is not inherently related to natural language. We further break down LLM4RL based on the component of the RL training framework that the LLM assists or replaces, namely reward shaping, goal generation, and policy function. Finally, in the third class, RL+LLM, an LLM and an RL agent are embedded in a common planning framework without either of them contributing to training or fine-tuning of the other. We further branch this class to distinguish between studies with and without natural language feedback. We use this taxonomy to explore the motivations behind the synergy of LLMs and RL and explain the reasons for its success, while pinpointing potential shortcomings and areas where further research is needed, as well as alternative methodologies that serve the same goal. ©2024 The Authors.

Traditional questionnaires and interviews cannot fully and accurately reflect the attention and sentiments. Social media interactions can provide a new data-driven perspective to explore the sentiment toward EVs. This study uses data from public posts on Weibo to investigate intersectionality in EV - sentiment and attention as per user, gender and region. On a 1,149,243-text corpus extracted from the Weibo posts, a computational social science methodology was employed with a mixed-method of deep learning and topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. Results showed that attention toward EVs mainly comes from official users rather than individual users (IUs), and IUs' attention is closely linked with EV policy change. Additionally, the attention level and growth rate toward EVs vary across regions and men pay more attention to EVs. There exist significant differences in both positive and negative sentiment driving factors across genders. This study facilitates to EVs’ policy-making and strategy in China and other countries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In South Korea, rapid territorial changes have exposed personal-level issues, while current systems limited public engagement capabilities have constrained policymaking. Although efforts have been made to bridge this gap, they have been hindered by the lack of an effective medium. This study introduces a novel framework, PRiSm (Policy Recommendation Systems in Cadastral Survey), which leverages National Public Opinion Big Data. We collected and analyzed two key data sources: 1) public opinion data from 2018 to 2023, which correlates strongly with cadastral resurveys across South Korea, and 2) content from 54 major news media outlets over the same period. The first data set represents bottom-up opinions at the individual level, while the second reflects top-down perspectives on national issues. The PRiSm system, developed in this study, utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including Word2Vec and a Genetic Algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, to process over a thousand inquiries and news articles. Our results highlight how different groups engage in discussions shaped by their interests and concerns, revealing key sensitivities and recommending terms invaluable for stakeholders and policymakers. We anticipate that PRiSm will offer meaningful insights for the public and decision-makers. Additionally, with more advanced ML and/or Deep Learning algorithms, there is significant potential for further advancements in NLP within the PRiSm framework. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Alarmingly, numerous countries have seen a sharp increase in hate crimes driven by malicious hate campaigns. While the detection of hate speech has gained attention as a major research field, the complexities of its genesis and spread across online social networks remain largely unexamined. In this study, we focus on developing a benchmark dataset for hate and abusive speech, related to various aspects of Indian politics, and religious topics. The dataset comprises of a vast user base of politically active individuals, enabling us to capture the nuances of hate speech propagation within this context. Additionally, we employ advanced topic modeling techniques to analyze the data, uncovering the underlying themes and user reactions associated with the data. This detailed analysis reveals how people respond to these topics, the temporal activation of discussions, and the comparative trends between different hashtags. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers, social media companies, and researchers, helping them develop better strategies to reduce hate speech and promote positive online interactions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods: We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results: The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions: When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

Existing methods for identifying helpful reviews are based on the supervised learning paradigm. The capacity of supervised methods, however, is limited by the lack of annotated reviews. In addition, there is a serious distributional bias between the labeled and unlabeled reviews. Therefore, this paper proposes a reinforced semi-supervised neural learning method (abbreviated as RSSNL) for helpful review identification, which can automatically select high-related unlabeled reviews to help training. Concretely, RSSNL composes with a reinforced unlabeled review selection policy and a semi-supervised pseudo-labeling review classifier. These two parts train jointly and integrate together based on the policy gradient framework. Extensive experiments on Amazon product reviews verify the effectiveness of RSSNL for using unlabeled reviews. © 2020 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A comparative analysis of public statements and SNS posts by delegates to the United Nations\n                    ABSTRACT: Introduction: This article investigates the evolving landscape of diplomacy in the digital age, focusing on diplomats at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York. The central inquiry revolves around how diplomatic actors use digital tools to complement or augment traditional face-to-face diplomacy. Methods: We systematically compare a substantial corpus of X posts (tweets) from UN diplomats with their public statements at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), employing advanced computational social science techniques. This study applies a range of large-scale text analysis methods, including word embedding, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, to investigate systematic differences between offline and online communication. Results: Our analysis reveals that, while the essence of diplomacy remains consistent across both domains, there is strategic selectivity in the use of online platforms by diplomats. Online communication emphasizes non-security topics, ceremonial matters, and prominent policy stances, in contrast to the operational issues common in UNSC deliberations. Additionally, online discourse adopts a less confrontational, more public diplomacy-oriented tone, with variations among countries. Discussion: This study offers one of the first systematic comparisons between offline and online diplomatic messages. It illuminates how diplomats navigate the digital realm to complement traditional roles. The findings indicate that some elements of public diplomacy and nation branding, directed toward a wider audience far beyond the council chamber, have become an integral part of multilateral diplomacy unfolding at the UNSC.

Surprisingly, crashes involving vehicles with L2 driving automation contributed to the public's discussion of L3-L5 AVs. Understanding the variations in public perception of AVs is imperative, which could significantly affect the future evolution of AVs. Respondents have few opportunities to express their views freely in survey-based studies relying on structured questionnaires (e.g., Likert scale). We collected 42,111 comments from Chinese mainstream social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Tik Tok) in August 2021 and applied advanced text mining technology (Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, text network analysis, and sentiment analysis) to understand variations in public perception of AVs before and after the crashes. The results show that the public expresses more blame for vehicles with L2 driving automation than human drivers and has misunderstandings about the current development of L3-L5 AVs, which is closely connected with publicity from automobile companies and media. Women were more negative than men both before and after the crash, and the sentiment difference was most significant in the first three days of the crash. This research provides new ideas for a timely understanding of the public perception of AVs. Findings contribute to specific policy recommendations to help in the technological change and wider adoption of AVs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It identifies three phases where parts of the text of legislative acts can be developed: (1) agenda-setting; (2) intra-institutional decision-making and (3) interinstitutional negotiations, depending on whether the content of the legislation originates respectively in the Commission proposal, the co-legislators’ positions or trilogue negotiations. Using a newly developed text-mining technique which computes in which phase each word of a legislative act originally appears, the article examines the relative importance of each phase and explores how it is affected by interinstitutional conflict. Applying this method to 219 legislative acts adopted between 2012 and 2018, it finds that most EU legislation originates in the agenda-setting phase, and that the new content developed during trilogue negotiations is limited. However, the importance of the agenda-setting phase decreases in cases with high levels of interinstitutional conflict. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study delves into the integration of the metaverse in the tourism and education sectors in China, aiming to uncover the intricate dynamics of public perceptions and the educational potential of this digital innovation. This research utilizes semantic network and sentiment analysis of social media discussions on China’s Weibo platform to provide a detailed understanding of sentiments toward the metaverse’s impact on tourism education. Semantic Network Analysis explores the complex dialog surrounding the metaverse in the context of lifelong learning. The findings reveal a balanced mix of enthusiasm for the immersive educational opportunities afforded by the metaverse and concerns regarding data privacy, digital addiction, and ethical considerations. It is evident from this duality that a balanced approach is necessary when the metaverse is integrated into tourism and learning while being sensitive to technological opportunities and ethical challenges. The metaverse could be an immersive, interactive learning environment endorsed by modern educational theories, supporting active learning through experience. The metaverse will provide valuable assistance to tourism education, which will help enhance this field through the simulation of real tourism for students to learn, which will foster cultural understanding and meet the demands of a globalized tourism industry. It further recommends that policies and practices should be formulated to ensure equal access, respect for the privacy of every participant, and the ethical use of the technology. This study contributes to the analysis of the potentials and challenges of the metaverse in the tourism and learning industry. It highlights the metaverse as an ‘emerging tool for lifelong learning’ and offers insights into how educators, policymakers, and industry leaders, all aiming at the integration of digital innovations in education, should exploit the metaverse. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Software platforms aiming to support digital deliberation usually suffer from information overload, due to the large amount of feedback that is often provided. While Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques can alleviate this drawback, their complex structure discourages users from trusting their results. This paper proposes two Explainable Artificial Intelligence models to enhance transparency and trust in the modus operandi of the above techniques, which concern the processes of clustering and summarization of citizens’ feedback that has been uploaded on a digital deliberation platform. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study focuses on the context analysis of one of the megacities in China - Shenzhen, pointing out that migration was a key driver of Shenzhen’s development. And migration and industrialization led to a unique urbanization phenomenon: the ‘symbiosis’ of urban villages and industrial parks, where migrants live and work. However, it is argued that during an economic and social transition period, even though the migrants account for most of Shenzhen’s population, the risk of losing jobs and the unaffordable housing in Shenzhen, are expelling them. On the contrary, the migrants, as well as other early-stage starters in the city, are young and have the intention to improve themselves and promote their career. But the current urban renewal movement, targeting urban villages and industrial parks, does not take the inclusiveness of urban migrants into account is defined as the problem. To translate this social issue of inclusiveness into the spatial arena, arrival city theory is referred to and expanded to a wider discourse, emphasizing the importance of affordable work-related space for migrants and other career starters to promote their career in this specific context. Thus, the research topic on providing affordable work-related space is stated. In order to understand the relationship between socio-economic performativity and urban form, both mathematical analysis approach of space syntax by Hillier and descriptive disciplines suggested by Jacobs, Montgomery, Gehl and Lynch are referred to and verified in this context. As a result of verification, the positive relation between street integration and retailing performativity is revealed, as well as the importance of wide sidewalk, pedestrian-friendly street and attractive public space. The analysis of urban patterns through space syntax profiled the spatial structure and spatial qualities on a local scale, and based on these, planning principles were set for urban strategies in the future. © 2019 Beijing JiaoTong University.

Consequently, software requirements must conform to those privacy policies. To help stakeholders extract privacy goals from policies, we introduce a semiautomated framework that combines crowdworker annotations, natural language typed dependency parses, and a reusable lexicon to improve goal-extraction coverage, precision, and recall. The framework evaluation consists of a five-policy corpus governing web and mobile information systems, yielding an average precision of 0.73 and recall of 0.83. The results show that no single framework element alone is sufficient to extract goals; however, the overall framework compensates for elemental limitations. Human annotators are highly adaptive at discovering annotations in new texts, but those annotations can be inconsistent and incomplete; dependency parsers lack sophisticated, tacit knowledge, but they can perform exhaustive text search for prospective requirements indicators; and while the lexicon may never completely saturate, the lexicon terms can be reliably used to improve recall. Lexical reuse reduces false negatives by 41%, increasing the average recall to 0.85. Last, crowd workers were able to identify and remove false positives by around 80%, which improves average precision to 0.93. © 2016 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For institutions which are not directly elected by voters, such as the European Commission (EC), social media can be a strategic tool for increasing perceived legitimacy and citizen engagement, especially in contexts of high politicization. In this paper, we use natural language processing techniques to provide a comprehensive overview of how EC communication on Twitter has evolved between 2010 and 2022, with respect to both its topics and its style. Our analyses show that, over time, the focus of EC communication has shifted substantially from economy-, finance- and governance-related topics, towards social policy, digital and environmental policy, and identity. These changes have progressively differentiated the EC’s profile from that of other institutions (especially more technocratic ones) and contributed to better alignment with engagement patterns of its social media audience. In addition, EC communication has become less neutral (in favor of more positive sentiment), simpler, and more readable, all features which are associated with more accessible and engaging messaging. Yet, while the EC currently scores better than most other reference agencies on several descriptors of accessibility, its style is still lexically more complex, less concrete and less action-oriented than that of other institutions. Alongside providing novel insights on how the EC’s online communication and projected political identity have changed over time, this study lays the foundations for future experimental and hypothesis-driven work combining social media data with external data sources. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, based on the time stage, text mining technology and visualization are used to conduct an in-depth analysis of (2016–2023) Year China's agricultural cold chain logistics policy. Under the configuration of the Python 3.7 environment, a total of 21 theme words were extracted from three-time stages by (LDA), and the importance of each theme was visualized and analyzed using Enriched Difference and Chord Diagrams (ECD), to explore the evolutionary trend of the policies at different stages. It is found that at various stages of the development of cold chain logistics for agricultural products, the content of policies ranges from enterprise operation to industry construction to government assistance, and the nature of policies is gradually systematized and standardized. The results of this paper not only have a guiding effect on the theoretical improvement of the policy system of agricultural cold chain logistics and have important practical significance for the development of agricultural cold chain logistics in China. © 2025 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For three years we were involved in a U.S. National Science Foundation funded project designed to enhance the participation of citizens in government agency rulemaking processes using online public deliberation and Natural Language Processing technologies. Despite a promising approach in an important arena for direct and regular public engagement, the project was met with serious obstacles in trying to secure a partnership with a government agency or interest groups. This led us to consider the policy process literature for insights regarding the obstacles we faced. That literature, a mainstay in the public policy and public administration curriculum in the U.S. and an attempt to capture how policy makers actually make decisions, heavily focuses on institutional actors and their adversarial relationships. Yet, it provides for hardly any role for the public to participate in what ideally should be a democratic process. Important components of the literature imply that institutional actors should discourage direct public engagement. The analysis seeks to clarify leverage points and contexts that could be used to promote online public engagement as a regular component of government processes. © 2011-IOS Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using Twitter Application Program Interface (API), we collected the tweets containing the hashtags #CommonCore and #CCSS for 12 months from 2014 to 2015. A Common Core corpus was created by compiling all the collected 660,051 tweets. The results of sentiment analysis suggest Twitter users expressed overwhelmingly negative sentiment toward the CCSS in all 50 states. Five topic clusters were detected by cluster analysis of the hashtag co-occurrence network. We also found that most of the opinion leaders were those who expressed negative sentiment toward the CCSS on Twitter. This study for the first time demonstrates how text mining techniques can be applied to education policy research, laying the foundation for real-time analytics of public opinion on education policies, thereby informing policymaking and implementation. © The Author(s) 2017.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

During the last decade, several platforms and applications have been developed to store, process and analyse big and heterogeneous volumes of such data. Having thoroughly considered various techniques and approaches used to index, analyse and reason about these types of data, this paper proposes a hybrid knowledge graph and semantic-based approach for querying earth observation data sources. The proposed approach acts as a unified framework for diverse earth observation data sources, which does not only enhance data accessibility, but also enables the discovery of previously hidden knowledge and the extraction of meaningful insights. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This book explores current cybersecurity trends and effective software applications, AI, and decision-making processes to combat cyberattacks. It emphasizes the importance of compliance, provides downloadable digital forensics software, and examines the psychology of organizational practice for effective cybersecurity leadership. Since the year 2000, research consistently reports devasting results of ransomware and malware attacks impacting healthcare and higher education. These attacks are crippling the ability for these organizations to effectively protect their information systems, information technology, and cloud-based environments. Despite the global dissemination of knowledge, healthcare and higher education organizations continue wrestling to define strategies and methods to secure their information assets, understand methods of assessing qualified practitioners to fill the alarming number of opened positions to help improve how cybersecurity leadership is deployed, as well as improve workplace usage of technology tools without exposing these organizations to more severe and catastrophic cyber incidents. This practical book supports the reader with downloadable digital forensics software, teaches how to utilize this software, as well as correctly securing this software as a key method to improve usage and deployment of these software applications for effective cybersecurity leadership. Furthermore, readers will understand the psychology of industrial organizational practice as it correlates with cybersecurity leadership. This is required to improve management of workplace conflict, which often impedes personnel's ability to comply with cybersecurity law and policy, domestically and internationally. © 2025 River Publishers.

In this study, we investigate the issue of users' car parking behaviour through a comprehensive analysis of related hashtags collected from the Twitter social media platform. For this purpose, we adopted a two-step strategy where in the first stage, a surface-level analysis of the identified hashtags involving inductive reasoning, sentiment analysis, and user interaction in terms of engagement and diversity scores is performed. In the second phase, a tweet content analysis is performed using sentiment analysis and Empath categorization with respect to the most frequent wordings (assimilating to separate topics), in the same spirit as aspect-sentiment analysis, to gain further insights regarding the occurrence of negative and positive posts. A quantitative evaluation of the coherence of the Empath categorization indicates that achieved 0.83% coherence score and outperformed both LDA and LSA that had a score of 0.77% and 0.76% respectively. Furthermore, the common word technique assimilated to aspect sentiment compared to the state-of-the-art model for aspect sentiment-based deberta-v3-base model. Besides, the influence of bots or spammers is evaluated using engagement/diversity measures and Botometer API. The results provide valuable insights in terms of discriminating between positive and negative posts and the correlation of surface-level analysis with content-based analysis, as well as the impact of various categorizations. The results expect to enable urban planners and policymakers to advance evidence-based policing in the future design of intelligent parking systems. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper aims to analyze the key obstacles of prefabricated building extension systematically and propose corresponding countermeasures. Firstly, the obstacles of prefabricated components were sorted out by the web text mining technique combined with investigation and survey. Secondly, an analytical model was established based on the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method and the interpretive structural modeling (ISM). Thirdly, the intelligent algorithms were applied to solve the model, and the detailed discussion about quantification of the influence degree among obstacles, the identification of the key obstacles, and the causal mechanism analysis is conducted. Based on the calculation result, targeting countermeasures and policy recommendations are put forward to alleviate these obstacle factors. © 2022 ICCREM 2022: Carbon Peak and Neutrality Strategies of the Construction Industry - Proceedings of the International Conference on Construction and Real Estate Management 2022.

Evaluation of policy is an essential and vital process required to measure the performance or pro-gression of the scheme. The main purpose of policy evaluation is to empower various stakeholders and enhance their socio-economic environment. A large number of policies or schemes in different areas are launched/constituted by government in view of the citizen welfare. Although, the governmental policies intend to better shape up the quality of life of people but may also impact their eve-ryday's life. Objective: The contemplation of public opinion plays a very significant role in the process of policy evaluation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to incorporate the concept of opinion mining in policy evaluation. An attempt has been made to elevate the process of policy evaluation by analyzing public opinion. Methods: A latest governmental scheme Saubhagya launched by the Indian government in 2017 has been selected for evaluation by applying supervised learning based opinion mining techniques. The data set of public opinion associated with this scheme has been captured by Twitter. Results: The result validates that the proposed methodology supports the optimizing process of policy evaluation and provides a more accurate and actual status of policy's effect among Indian citizen. As a result, this would aid in identifying and implementing the preventive and corrective measures required to be taken for a successful policy. Conclusion: The proposed methodology will stabilize and strengthen the process of policy evaluation which target towards favourable and flourishing future prospects concerning the socio-economic status of a nation. The results are quite exciting and further extension of work will be performed in order to develop and design a patent framework in the area of social big data analytics. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Social media platforms provide open and large-scale data on how the public views NEVs. Accordingly, based on data collected from Sina Weibo, the largest open social media platform in China, this study adopts web crawler and text mining to explore public attitudes and sentiments toward NEVs. The results show that the majority of NEVs followers belong to the media and broadcasting unit, which may lead to exaggerated advertising of NEVs performance. Public pay more attention to NEVs in environmental pollution and developed economies regions than others. In addition, it is found that the public is generally concerned about driving range, policies, battery charging and safety performance, and NEVs-related attributes. Some interesting findings are that preferential policies such as unrestricted driving are more popular with the public than tax incentives, and the public attaches a high degree of importance to the brand in the attributes of NEVs. Moreover, the Chinese public has relatively positive sentiments on NEVs, mainly due to the impact of China's carbon reduction targets. Negative sentiments are mainly due to safety and battery technology issues. Finally, some policy implications derived from the discussion are given. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

DoDAF is the basis for integrated architectures and provides broad levels of specification related to operational, system, and technical views. In our earlier work, we described an approach to support specification of DoDAF architectures within a development environment based on DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) for semi-automated construction of the needed simulation models. The result is an enhanced system lifecycle development process that includes both development and testing in an integral manner. We also developed automated model generation using XML which paves the way for OVs to become service-providing components in the Web Services architecture. In this paper we present the semantic structure for one of the Operational View documents OV-6a that would aid the development of these semi-automated models. We will describe how OV-6a can be structured in a more generalized meta-model framework such that every rule is reducible to meaningful code which is automatedly constructed through Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and further be reduced to DEVS based models. The paper also presents an overview of the Life-cycle development methodology for these enterprise architectures and how a common enterprise domain-model can be used in customized business/domain-specific rules and policy structures. © 2006 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, many existing studies are limited in suggesting management plans that fit the characteristics of different age groups of people visiting national parks. Therefore, this study aims to identify the requirements for national parks and set the direction for national park services by age group. Methods: This study collected the requirements for national parks from 902 people of different ages through an online self-administered questionnaire and analyzed them through semantic link network analysis. Results: As a result of the analysis, there were management requirements in two areas related to the environment (rubbish and ecological environment, facilities environment such as safety and forest fires) and one area related to the economy, and a monitoring system for rubbish and ecological environment and a private land management policy for the economy were identified as alternatives. The younger generation was interested in environmental issues, the older generation was interested in economic issues, and the elderly was interested in the facilities environment for safety and forest fires. Therefore, it was found that environmental campaigns should be conducted for the younger generation, admission fees and parking rates should be improved for the older generation, and a safe tour environment should be provided for the elderly. Conclusion: The needs analysis found that it is necessary to establish a monitoring system for all national parks from an environmental perspective and improve the management policy about private land from an economic perspective. Furthermore, environmental campaigns and events were required for the younger generation, benefits related to entrance fees for the elderly, and policies to create a safe facilities environment for the elderly. Establishing such national park policies will improve the satisfaction of users. © 2023 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

North Korea made many attempts using these nuclear weapons. In September 2017, North Korea succeeded the sixth nuclear test and launched a missile in November 2017. In May 2017 South Korea attacked by Ransomware which is Wannacry. The possibility of North Korea’s execution was suggested. They provoke not only in physical space but also in cyber space. North Korea’s attack is getting sophisticated in cyber-attack. In addition, North Korea’s prestige is getting higher in cyberspace because only they possess nuclear weapon. The reason is that when North Korea conducted a nuclear test, almost all the world news broadcast about North Korea's nuclear test. In the cyberspace the articles or SNS, people call North Korea is the most dangerous and threat nation. If North Korea intimidates information about nuclear weapons and missiles through cyber space, the possibility of social turmoil may increase through weapons that have never actually been seen. Currently the target is South Korea but when this social turmoil increased the target will spread to all over the world. In order to prevent such social turmoil, this study identifies the symbolic meaning of nuclear weapon in cyber space. To find the meaning this paper uses the recent nuclear test of North Korea and measures the risk through SNS(Social Network Service) and online articles. To measure the risk, in this research use the FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) model which it can analyzes risk by factors. In this paper propose countermeasure policy against cyber psychological warfare through final risk. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc.

However, their adoption in government remains limited, and harnessing their benefits while preventing unintended consequences remains a challenge. While prior work has focused on improving NLP performance, this work examines how different internal government stakeholders influence NLP tools' thoughtful adoption. We interviewed seven politicians (politically appointed officials as heads of government institutions) and thirteen public servants (career government employees who design and administrate policy interventions), inquiring how they choose whether and how to use NLP tools to support civic participation processes. The interviews suggest that policymakers across both groups focused on their needs for career advancement and the need to showcase the legitimacy and fairness of their work when considering NLP tool adoption and use. Because these needs vary between politicians and public servants, their preferred NLP features and tool designs also differ. Interestingly, despite their differing needs and opinions, neither group clearly identifies who should advocate for NLP adoption to enhance civic participation or address the unintended consequences of a poorly considered adoption. This lack of clarity in responsibility might have caused the governments' low adoption of NLP tools. We discuss how these findings reveal new insights for future HCI research. They inform the design of NLP tools for increasing civic participation efficiency and capacity, the design of other tools and methods that ensure thoughtful adoption of AI tools in government, and the design of NLP tools for collaborative use among users with different incentives and needs.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this context, discussion on spent nuclear fuel is a prerequisite to expanding nuclear energy, as it leads to the issue of radioactive waste disposal. Given the dearth of study on spent nuclear fuel public acceptance, we use text mining and big data analysis on the news article and public comments data on Naver news portal to identify the Korean public opinion on spent nuclear fuel. We identify that the Korean public is more interested in the nuclear energy policy than spent nuclear fuel itself and that the alternative energy sources affect the position towards spent nuclear fuel. We recommend relating spent nuclear fuel issue with nuclear energy policy and environmental issues of alternative energy sources to further promote spent nuclear fuel. © 2022 Korean Nuclear Society\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge about structure of co-commenting. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a dataset of 17,386 full text posts written by top 2,000 LiveJournal bloggers and over 520,000 comments that result in about 4.5 million edges in the network of co-commenting, where posts are vertices. The Louvain algorithm is used to detect communities of co-commenting. Cosine similarity and topic modeling based on latent Dirichlet allocation are applied to study topical coherence within these communities. Findings – Bloggers unite into moderately manifest communities by commenting roughly the same sets of posts. The graph of co-commenting is sparse and connected by a minority of active non-top commenters. Communities are centered mainly around blog authors as opinion leaders and, to a lesser extent, around a shared topic or topics. Research limitations/implications – The research has to be replicated on other datasets with more thorough hand coding to ensure the reliability of results and to reveal average proportions of topic-centered communities. Practical implications – Knowledge about factors around which co-commenting communities emerge, in particular clustered opinion leaders that often attract such communities, can be used by policy makers in marketing and/or political campaigning when individual leadership is not enough or not applicable. Originality/value – The research contributes to the social studies of online communities.

Often, policymakers and tech industry players invoke artificial intelligence as the solution to complex challenges around online content, promising that AI is a scant few years away from resolving everything from hate speech to harassment to the spread of terrorist propaganda. Missing from these promises, however, is an acknowledgement that proactive identification and automated removal of user-generated content raises problems beyond issues of “accuracy” and overbreadth--problems that will not be solved with more sophisticated AI. In this commentary, I discuss how the technical realities of content filtering stack up against the protections for freedom of expression in international human rights law. As policymakers and companies around the world turn to AI for communications governance, it is crucial that we recall why legal protections for speech have included presumptions against prior censorship, and consider carefully how proactive content moderation will fundamentally re-shape the relationship between rules, people, and their speech. © The Author(s) 2020.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In addition, this study seeks to examine the characteristics of the messages, content, and engagement rates of the information which has been published by the four central government bodies responsible for the management of the emerging crisis in Israel. This article is based on content analysis to examine the work of four main government ministries on Facebook (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance) throughout the first six months of the crisis from February to July 2020. Findings indicate that The Ministry of Health's posts yielded the highest engagement rates compared to the rest of the ministries. Also, we categorized the posts into four main categories: Policy, Advocacy & COVID-19 additional information, Restrictions, Guidelines & Recommendations. In terms of Sentiment analysis, posts containing restrictions have created the highest emotional reactions (positive and negative). Research findings can be deduced regarding modes of distribution in terms of messages, publication dates, and types of content to improve users' responses in terms of audience engagement and sentiment. © 2023 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this study, we propose to explicitly incorporate the query costs in the static caching policy. To this end, a query's cost is represented by its execution time, which involves CPU time to decompress the postings and compute the query-document similarities to obtain the final top-N answers. Simulation results using a large Web crawl data and a real query log reveal that the proposed strategy improves overall system performance in terms of the total query execution time. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The present study aims to analyze the global research topics in information science and library science, while also reviewing research topics from previous years and identifying thematic gaps. This analysis will provide a foundation for planning and policy research in this field. Methodology: The present study utilized an automated classification technique. Data analysis was performed on 85,403 articles indexed on the Web of Science website between 1945 and 2019 in the field of library and information science. The source and tool used for extracting research data was Web of Science. After preparing and pre-processing the data and formulating the classification plan for articles across 31 thematic categories, the logistic regression algorithm has been employed for the automatic classification of articles. This algorithm assigns articles to their respective thematic categories using the Cosine similarity criterion. The various stages of the research were performed using the Python 3.7 programming language and the Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, and Plotly software packages. Findings: Most of the global research in this field is dedicated to information technology, while the field of organizational management has the least amount of research. The growth trend of research in many thematic areas is increasing. However, there is further growth in areas such as web studies, information technology, information behavior, user studies, in formation retrieval, and search engines. After the 1990s, popular terms such as social media, big data, virtual library, IoT (Internet of Things), machine learning, deep learning, data mining, open data, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, cloud computing, virtual reality, augmented reality, and machine translation have emerged in research in this field. It appears that the utilization of keywords pertaining to traditional subjects in the field has declined, while the usage of concepts encompassing new topics related to technology and the web has increased. The rapid growth of fields such as web development, technology, artificial intelligence, and data mining has led to the evolution of research topics and increased connections with computer science and information technology, particularly in recent years. The changes in the subjects of this field can be attributed to the development of the web and advancements in technology. Additionally, the concepts and research topics in this field have had an impact on globalization, communication progress, and overall development in various economic, social, and cultural dimensions. Conclusion: The conclusion of the study highlights the thematic trends in library and information science research over different time periods. It also identifies the weaknesses in the scientific output of this field, while outlining the evolutionary process and the path of progress and development in the field of science. Due to the fact that scientific outputs are derived from the issues, needs, and priorities of a society at any given time, studying them can help clarify the most important issues and research needs in the field of library and information science. This, in turn, can provide a foundation for identifying future research needs and subjects in the field. In other words, having a clear understanding of the subject areas of library and information science will help researchers in this field identify the most important issues and needs. This, in turn, will enable them to take appropriate actions when selecting topics for future research. By conducting needs-based research, we can lay the groundwork for policy development and research planning in this field. This approach will also help address potential challenges and problems that may arise. This is despite the fact that if the needs and issues are ignored, research resources and credits will be spent on topics that do not have the necessary priority and importance. It cannot be expected that the findings from these topics will solve the problems and pave the way for the advancement of this field. © 2023, Shahed University.

Despite the significant rise in women entrepreneurship, challenges persist, including gender-based barriers, limited access to capital, and regional disparities. Understanding these dynamics is essential for formulating policies that support and empower women entrepreneurs. Method: The present study employed a systematic literature review (SLR) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an advanced topic modeling technique, to identify prevalent themes within the literature. Data was extracted from Scopus-indexed journals (2000–2024), systematically filtered, and analyzed to uncover key patterns in women entrepreneurship research. Results: The analysis identifies four central themes: (1) Women in Entrepreneurship and Gender Roles, (2) Small Business and Women Enterprises, (3) Social Impact of Women Entrepreneurs, and (4) Challenges Faced by Female Entrepreneurs. The findings highlight the transformative potential of digital platforms in enhancing business opportunities for women and addressing traditional constraints, such as mobility and market access. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to enhance digital literacy, bridge socio-cultural disparities, and establishing inclusive policies that foster a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem. By synthesizing existing literature, this research provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, financial institutions, and stakeholders to strengthen women-led enterprises and drive gender-equitable growth.

Challenges and risks of bias in large language models\n                    ABSTRACT: As generative language models, exemplified by ChatGPT, continue to advance in their capabilities, the spotlight on biases inherent in these models intensifies. This paper delves into the distinctive challenges and risks associated with biases specifically in large-scale language models. We explore the origins of biases, stemming from factors such as training data, model specifications, algorithmic constraints, product design, and policy decisions. Our examination extends to the ethical implications arising from the unintended consequences of biased model outputs. In addition, we analyze the intricacies of mitigating biases, acknowledging the inevitable persistence of some biases, and consider the consequences of deploying these models across diverse applications, including virtual assistants, content generation, and chatbots. Finally, we provide an overview of current approaches for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating biases in language models, underscoring the need for a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort to craft AI systems that embody equity, transparency, and responsibility. This article aims to catalyze a thoughtful discourse within the AI community, prompting researchers and developers to consider the unique role of biases in the domain of generative language models and the ongoing quest for ethical AI. © This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Discussing the relation between SNS and open innovation\n                    ABSTRACT: The millennial generation plays a leading role in today's connected world in which exists a confluence of numerous technologies and the internet in science, economy and innovation. This study aimed to identify the key factors that characterize the millennial generation within the online chatter on Twitter using an innovative approach. To this end, we analyzed the user generated content (UGC) in the social network (SNS) Twitter using a three-steps knowledge-based method for information management. In order to develop this method, we first used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a state-of-the-art thematic modeling tool that works with Python, to analyze topics in our database. The data were collected by extracting tweets with the hashtag #Millennial, #Millennials and #MillennialGeneration on Twitter (n = 35,401 tweets). Secondly, sentiment analysis with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was also developed using machine-learning. Applying this method to the LDA results resulted in the categorization of the topics into those that contained negative, positive and neutral sentiments. Thirdly, in order to gather the final results, data text mining techniques were used. The negative factors that characterize the behavior of this generation are depression, loneliness and real-world relationship. The positive factors are body image, self-expression, travelers and digital life and the neutral factors are self-identity and anxiety. Practical implications can be used by public actors, companies or policy makers that are focused on the millennial generation as a target. The study has important theoretical applications as the topics discovered can be used to test quantitative models based on the findings and insights extracted from the UGC sample. © 2019 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While being a powerful algorithm, their work has focused on computer vision tasks, where it is comparatively easy to apply imperceptible perturbations without changing an image's semantic meaning. In our work, we adapt AutoAugment to automatically discover effective perturbation policies for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as dialogue generation. We start with a pool of atomic operations that apply subtle semantic-preserving perturbations to the source inputs of a dialogue task (e.g., different POS-tag types of stopword dropout, grammatical errors, and paraphrasing). Next, we allow the controller to learn more complex augmentation policies by searching over the space of the various combinations of these atomic operations. Moreover, we also explore conditioning the controller on the source inputs of the target task, since certain strategies may not apply to inputs that do not contain that strategy's required linguistic features. Empirically, we demonstrate that both our input-agnostic and input-aware controllers discover useful data augmentation policies, and achieve significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art, including trained on manually-designed policies. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It is gradually being introduced to support new forms of research, discovery, and reuse of library contents in advanced and interesting ways. University libraries have the potential to substantially improve their library services through the implementation of sophisticated AI tools. This study explored the application of AI tools in the university libraries of Pakistan, as well as draw a comparison in the usage of AI tools between public and private sector universities. This is a quantitative study and data is collected through survey methodology. We used purposive sampling to collect the data from 175 university libraries. The collected data was analyzed using a statistical package for social sciences (SPSS-version 22). Findings indicate that while AI-based services are starting to be introduced into university libraries in Pakistan, no university library has implemented the full suite of AI-based tools. Natural language processing, voice searching, and chatbots are the most familiar and popular tools currently used in libraries. However, robotics technology is rarely used with a mean value of (1.62) because of the financial investment and high level of IT skills required. We found that private university libraries are using AI tools more as compared with public sector university libraries. The study concludes with several key recommendations, including closer collaboration between the library and the respective university IT department for technical support and assistance; improved financial support and ICT infrastructure to establish AI technology-based library services; and training development plans for library staff. Insights gained from this study should contribute to the capacity of Pakistani University librarians and their staff to maximize the full potential of AI within their institutions. The research implications are helpful to library leaders and policymakers in building a policy for AI-based technology in their respective university libraries. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These resources may or may not be educational. However, they can be harnessed for educational purposes by adapting and personalizing them to different learner needs. We propose to collaboratively annotate learning resources with a lightweight resource annotation metadata schema complemented by a folksonomy-derived semantic model. The annotation metadata schema follows a novel policy to associate numerical ratings to learners’ subjective expression of opinions on learning resources. On the other hand, the semantic model serves to support a collaborative resource recommendation algorithm based on the k-nearest neighbour approach. Proof-of-concept is demonstrated via a prototype Web-based recommender. Preliminary results indicate learners are confident with the recommended learning resources in terms of accuracy, usefulness, novelty and information adequacy. Formalization of folksonomy in annotating learning resources as well as in opinion mining from the crowd to rate resources may not only support personalization but also engage learners more effectively in technology-enhanced learning. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In Korea, in response to COVID-19, the COVID-19 vaccine approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety was sequentially administered to each group, raising national interest in the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of the vaccine, and securing the basis for related policies. Many attempts have been made for this. We are interested in a methodology to establish a scientific basis for how to respond to issues regarding vaccine stability due to the emergence of new infectious diseases. In this study, we use comments posted on Naver, the largest social platform in Korea, to obtain consumer sentiment information about vaccines and understand the change in Korean public sentiment in the first half of 2021 for each vaccine based on the analysis pipeline (SNSMiner_VAC). We investigated the Korean public's response to the COVID-19 vaccination on social media from November 30, 2021, to January 31, 2022. We collected comments related to the COVID-19 vaccination using the Korean words for “COVID-19 vaccination” as keywords. Of the 329,559 comments, 240,322 were analyzed after preprocessing. We developed three lexicons (stopwords, sentiment words, and custom words related to COVID-19) for Korean natural language processing. Furthermore, we extracted five clusters — including symptoms, side effects, vaccine hesitancy, pro-vaccination, and infectious disease control policy — through network analysis. The sentiment analysis revealed that negative public opinion was prominent even after the commencement of the phased recovery of daily life. From these results, we were able to automatically collect data-based information on patients’ symptoms and side effects for the new vaccine and prepare and analyze the basis for collecting public opinions about vaccination. We hope that the pipeline proposed in this study can be used as a tool to create a data source for effective management policies for vaccines being developed against the emergence of new infectious diseases. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative combat of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, incorporating large language model(LLM) into the process of aircraft pilots commanding and controlling multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The framework utilizes LLM for complex semantic understanding and monitoring of task instruction execution. It allows pilots to issue task instructions to UAVs using non-standard natural language. The received natural language task instructions are matched with the preloaded policy library of the designed task executor in UAVs, and an appropriate policy is selected for execution. During task execution, UAVs provide feedback on the task execution status to manned aircraft at key nodes, and continue task execution upon confirmation by manned aircraft until task completion or receipt of new task instructions. The framework is tested in typical beyond-visual-range combat scenarios of manned and unmanned aerial vehicle collaboration. It exhibits good human-machine interaction, robustness, trustworthiness, explainability, and effectively reducing the decision-making and operational burdens on pilots. The research findings of this paper can be widely applied to various task scenarios where humans and robots collaborate to accomplish tasks, providing a feasible technical route for the collaborative combat of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2024, International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences.

A study examining a case of rapid public health policy adaptation in China during the COVID-19 epidemic was conducted by gathering public opinion data from major social media platforms. A systematic approach to comprehend public opinion was developed. Five fundamental elements and four dimensions were delineated. An indicator system was established utilizing the K-means text clustering model. Public prediction, expectation, and their evolution underlying public concern were elucidated employing TF–IDF text mining models. The HMM elucidated the way public opinion influences policy adjustments. The findings underscore that public concern regarding enduring events undergoes temporal shifts, mirroring the evolution of public opinion towards policy. Public opinion aroused by both the original event and derived events collaboratively influence policy adjustments. In China, public opinion serves as a mechanism for policy feedback and oversight; notably, negative public sentiment plays a pivotal role in expediting policy transitions. These findings aid in refining policies to mitigate emergencies through a feedback loop, thereby averting the emergence of safety risks such as social unrest prompted by public opinion. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

After more than half a century of development and boom, these cities are starting to decline and industrial transformation is urgently needed. This paper focuses on evaluating the transformation capability of resource-based cities building an evaluation model. Using Text Mining and the Document Explorer technique as a way of extracting text features, the 200 most frequently used words are derived from 100 publications related to steel- and other resource-based cities. The Expert Evaluation Method (EEM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques are then applied to select 53 indicators, determine their weights and establish an index system for evaluating the transformation capability of the pillar industry of China's steel-based cities. Using real data and expert reviews, the improved Fuzzy Relation Matrix (FRM) method is applied to two case studies in China, namely Panzhihua and Daye, and the evaluation model is developed using Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE). The cities' abilities to carry out industrial transformation are evaluated with concerns expressed for the case of Daye. The findings have policy implications for the potential and required industrial transformation in the two selected cities and other resource-based towns. © 2015 Li et al.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using machine learning and text mining analyses, combined with qualitative narrative analysis, the study examines 53,441 news articles from 17 US, Mexican and Northern Triangle media outlets from 1999 to 2019, tracing and critiquing the shifts in coverage. Findings suggest that all three media systems generally align in their depiction of the scene, key agents and acts regarding migration; however, US narratives increasingly diverge from Northern Triangle and Mexican narratives regarding the purpose and instruments by which migration occurs, with US value claims narrowing over time emphasizing border security. This narrative trajectory within US media ignores migrants' determination and underlining rationales for migration, pushing them to take increasingly dangerous means to migrate to the USA and exacerbating the situation for all parties. © 2022 International Organization for Migration.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Teachers and students faced the challenge of communicating virtually and applying different teaching methods to put them beyond their comfort limits. The learning process is conducted in a fully electronic environment, which must be organized so that the materials provided are accessible to all learners. The aim of our paper is to propose a multi-layered e-learning framework that integrates methods and tools for managing the learning process in higher education. We based the current study on the experience gained during the pandemic in the training of Latvian and Bulgarian students. As part of our study, we conducted a survey among computer science students to examine the challenges they faced during the lockdown. To process the results, we applied the methods of statistical analysis and machine learning, particularly text mining. The total number of participants is 93, of which 48% are Latvians and the rest - Bulgarians. During the pandemic, the two groups of students used different types of conferencing software - Google Meat and MS Teams, and the same e-learning platform - Moodle.

China's governments have made relevant policies for this promising industry. This paper constructed a two-dimensional research framework of policy tools and policy objectives for quantitative study of policy texts. We analyzed 39 Chinese national policy texts from 2015 to 2019 in which the AI industry is mentioned. We found that for China's AI industry policy-making, supply-side policy tools are most widely used, whereas the application of environmental-side and demand-side policy tools are relatively limited. The policy objectives mainly focused on industrial upgrading. Due to the uneven distribution of policy tools applications, we put forward some suggestions for better AI industrial policy-making. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

There is growing evidence that social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) play a substantial effect in a wide range of health outcomes. Electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely employed to conduct observational studies in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). However, there has been limited review into how to make the most of SBDH information from EHRs using AI approaches. Methods. A systematic search was conducted in six databases to find relevant peer-reviewed publications that had recently been published. Relevance was determined by screening and evaluating the articles. Based on selected relevant studies, a methodological analysis of AI algorithms leveraging SBDH information in EHR data was provided. Results. Our synthesis was driven by an analysis of SBDH categories, the relationship between SBDH and healthcare-related statuses, natural language processing (NLP) approaches for extracting SBDH from clinical notes, and predictive models using SBDH for health outcomes. Discussion. The associations between SBDH and health outcomes are complicated and diverse; several pathways may be involved. Using NLP technology to support the extraction of SBDH and other clinical ideas simplifies the identification and extraction of essential concepts from clinical data, efficiently unlocks unstructured data, and aids in the resolution of unstructured data-related issues. Conclusion. Despite known associations between SBDH and diseases, SBDH factors are rarely investigated as interventions to improve patient outcomes. Gaining knowledge about SBDH and how SBDH data can be collected from EHRs using NLP approaches and predictive models improves the chances of influencing health policy change for patient wellness, ultimately promoting health and health equity.

The acuteness, global scale and intense dynamism of the situation make online news and information even more important for making informed management and policy decisions. This paper focuses on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to examine the news media as the main source of information and agenda-setters of public discourse over an eight-month period. The aim of this study is to understand which economic topics news media focused on alongside the dominant health coverage, which topics did not surface, and how these topics influenced each other and evolved over time and space. To this end, we used an extensive open-source dataset of over 350,000 media articles on non-medical aspects of COVID-19 retrieved from over 60 top-tier business blogs and news sites. We referred to the World Economic Forum’s Strategic Intelligence taxonomy to categorize the articles into a variety of topics. In doing so, we found that in the early days of COVID-19, the news media focused predominantly on reporting new cases, which tended to overshadow other topics, such as the economic impact of the virus. Different independent news sources reported on the same topics, showing a herd behavior of the news media during this global health crisis. However, a temporal analysis of news distribution in relation to its geographic focus showed that the rise in COVID-19 cases was associated with an increase in media coverage of relevant socio-economic topics. This research helps prepare for the prevention of social and economic crises when decision-makers closely monitor news coverage of viruses and related topics in other parts of the world. Thus, monitoring the news landscape on a global scale can support decision-making in social and economic crises. Our analyses point to ways in which this monitoring and issues management can be improved to remain alert to social dynamics and market changes. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We employed natural language processing (NLP) on Weibo text data to uncover how people’s emotions towards these containment measures changed over time and space. Our analysis reveals a critical evolution in public sentiment, transitioning from initial support to growing dissatisfaction, highlighting the impact of ‘pandemic fatigue’ and the socio-economic factors influencing these shifts. This study contributes to understanding the complex interplay between public health strategies and societal reactions, providing practical insights into the spatial variations of sentiment across different demographic and socio-economic groups. By elucidating the causal effects of containment policies on public sentiment and the subsequent rise in public skepticism, our research offers valuable lessons for policymakers in tailoring communication and interventions to mitigate negative public perceptions and foster compliance during health crises. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recently, the field met new challenges where new algorithms must contend with highly unstructured sources for sentiment expressions emanating from online social media fora. This study proposes a lexicon-based procedure to implement tweets sentiment analysis with improved algorithms. To deal with sources devoid of syntactic and grammatical structure, the approach incorporates lexicon-based text pre-processing using lexicon features such as tokenisation, parts-of-speech (POS), stop word removal, stemming, normalisation, word frequency and count for context analysis. However, since data in social network sites that primarily express sentiments are in multimodal forms, an analysis of multimedia content is required (i.e. retrieving text from audio, image and video). Hence a novel lexicon-based methodology and framework for multimodal sentiment analysis of text congregated from audio, images, and videos have been proposed. The lexicon-based approach classified the contents as positive, negative or neutral. The experiment results from STS-Gold datasets (recall = 93.2%, precision = 81.9%, F1-score = 87.2%, Accuracy = 92.29%) show the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared with those of other state-of-the-art research studies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since then, the law has been revised twice, and many improvements have been made, including the establishment of the Korea Consumer Protection Agency. Therefore, this study focuses on an empirical investigation of how media reports are conveying ‘consumer policy’ through a chronicle of the presidents. In this research, text mining and semantic network analysis were used on 2216 articles related to ‘consumer policy’ reported by governments from the Kim Yong-Sam government to the Park Geun-Hye government to 12 media. This study is meaningful in that it grasps meaning and change related to ‘consumer policy’, as well as the connectivity between words, from a structural point of view. © 2010 National Institute of Optoelectronics.

Methods: A total of 339 nurse-related articles published in Korean online newspapers from January 1 to December 31, 2020, were extracted by entering various combinations of OR and AND with the four words “Corona,” “COVID,” “Nursing,” and “Nurse” as search keywords using BIGKinds, a news database provided by the Korea Press Foundation. The collected data were analyzed with a keyword network analysis and topic modeling using NetMiner 4. Results: The top keywords extracted from the nurse-related news articles were, in the following order, “metropolitan area,” “protective clothing,” “government,” “task,” and “admission.” Four topics representing keywords were identified: “encouragement for dedicated nurses,” “poor work environment,” “front-line nurses working with obligation during the COVID-19 pandemic,” and “nurses' efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” Conclusion: The media’s attention to the dedication of nurses, the shortage of nursing resources, and the need for government support is encouraging in that it forms the public opinion necessary to lead to substantial improvements in treating nurses. The nursing community should actively promote policy proposals to improve treatment toward nurses by utilizing the net function of the media and proactively seek and apply strategies to improve the image of nurses working in various fields.

The study of impact, to date, has focused on direct and short-term mechanisms, such as alumni's entrepreneurial activities, faculty spin-outs, and active public engagement with policy agendas. Our point of departure is in conceptualizing and empirically testing a longer-term and more systemic mechanism. We theorize and empirically test how the entrepreneurial university imprints on its graduates, some of whom take on leadership positions in innovation policymaking years later. We test this relationship by employing a text-as-data approach to examine the extent to which innovation policy leaders speak about startup-centric innovation, comparing the media coverage of entrepreneurial university alumni relative to their peers. Our original dataset comprises the 485 individuals who held senior innovation policy positions in East Asia's eleven largest economies from 1998 to 2019, detailing their educational background and media coverage (10,816 documents). We conceptualize the alumni policymaker mechanism, which constitutes entrepreneurial university alumni shaping the future of national innovation policy by referring to startup-centric innovation three times more than their peers. Those who completed MBAs at entrepreneurial universities express an even greater preference for startup-centric innovation policy.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Definition, Factors for Enhancing Students Comprehension, and Computational Bibliometric Review Analysis\n                    ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to explain language education development research for improving student comprehension in learning science. This study also reviews the definition of these strategies, identifies factors that contribute to improving students' comprehension, and conducts a computational bibliometric review analysis to determine the efficacy of these approaches using Google Scholar with keywords Language and Learning Science from 2019 to 2023. There are also explanations for formal and informal learning, as well as educational levels for researching techniques and developing curriculum. The use of technology in media and laboratories is also a significant factor in increasing students' literacy and language impact. Language and student characteristics, motivation, teacher-student relationships, therapy, and psychological conditions are all inextricably linked. We also included information about language barriers for students with special needs, as well as new technologies that improve language learning, in which these can be factors in increasing student’s understanding of learning science. The bibliometric analysis results show that the trend of language research in learning science is decreasing year after year. This is due to the possibility that the focus of educational research has shifted to other areas, such as educational technology, science learning, or educational policy. The co-occurrence analysis results show several keywords that are frequently researched and should be paid attention to, including language model, natural language processing, deep learning, student, and language learning. These keywords denote important parameters that can improve the learning experience because they enable personalized, interactive, adaptive educational interventions, particularly in language learning contexts, by adapting content and feedback to each student's needs and preferences. This paper will be useful to educators in better understanding the current state of affairs concerning the importance of language in engineering teaching and learning. © 2023, Universitas Negeri Makassar- Faculty of Languages and Literature.

We define deception as the systematic inducement of false beliefs in the pursuit of some outcome other than the truth. We first survey empirical examples of AI deception, discussing both special-use AI systems (including Meta's CICERO) and general-purpose AI systems (including large language models). Next, we detail several risks from AI deception, such as fraud, election tampering, and losing control of AI. Finally, we outline several potential solutions: first, regulatory frameworks should subject AI systems that are capable of deception to robust risk-assessment requirements; second, policymakers should implement bot-or-not laws; and finally, policymakers should prioritize the funding of relevant research, including tools to detect AI deception and to make AI systems less deceptive. Policymakers, researchers, and the broader public should work proactively to prevent AI deception from destabilizing the shared foundations of our society. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, studies on the implementation of this policy proposition are limited. To address this gap in the literature, this study employs machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing (NLP), to examine 77 climate bond (CB) policies from 32 countries within the context of climate financing. The findings indicate that “sustainability” and “carbon emissions control” are the most outlined policy objectives in these CB policies. Additionally, the study highlights that most CB funds are invested toward energy projects (i.e., renewable, clean, and efficient initiatives). However, there has been a notable shift in the allocation of CB funds from climate-friendly energy projects to the construction sector between 2015 and 2019. This shift raises concerns about the potential redirection of funds from climate-focused investments to the real estate industry, potentially leading to the greenwashing of climate funds. Furthermore, policy sentiment analysis revealed that a minority of policies hold skeptical views on climate change, which may negatively influence climate actions. Thus, the findings highlight that the effective implementation of CB policies depends on policy goals, objectives, and sentiments. Finally, this study contributes to the literature by employing NLP techniques to understand policy sentiments in climate financing. © 2023 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Efects of LLM-Powered Search Systems on Diverse Information Seeking\n                    ABSTRACT: Large language models (LLMs) powered conversational search systems have already been used by hundreds of millions of people, and are believed to bring many benefits over conventional search. However, while decades of research and public discourse interrogated the risk of search systems in increasing selective exposure and creating echo chambers-limiting exposure to diverse opinions and leading to opinion polarization, little is known about such a risk of LLM-powered conversational search. We conduct two experiments to investigate: 1) whether and how LLM-powered conversational search increases selective exposure compared to conventional search; 2) whether and how LLMs with opinion biases that either reinforce or challenge the user's view change the effect. Overall, we found that participants engaged in more biased information querying with LLM-powered conversational search, and an opinionated LLM reinforcing their views exacerbated this bias. These results present critical implications for the development of LLMs and conversational search systems, and the policy governing these technologies. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In Taiwan, the fertility rate is experiencing long-Term downtrends, and consequently, ageing of their populations. In view of this, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the yearly trend for population ageing and declining fertility. We proposed the yearly trend analysis based on contextual text mining methods from government science and technology projects to extract the Chinese pattern and word about the population ageing and declining fertility. The government science and technology projects, which archives research projects sponsored by government, are retrieved from Government Research Bulletin (GRB) from 1981 to April 2021. Then, the two issue of policy Major trends and the importance of issues and Policies and action plans combine the population ageing and declining fertility with yearly trend are explored and discussed. The obtained results can be analyzed the yearly trend about fertility rate, elderly population, and youth workforce with population ageing and declining fertility on the first policy issue Major trends and the importance of issues. And it can also be analyzed the yearly trend about formulates the policies and action plan on the second policy issue Policies and action plans in Taiwan. According to the results of the analysis, we observe that the fertility rate and youth workforce have been a progressive decrease every year. Within 10 years, it will be expected to transition into a super-Aged society about the elderly population. In the future, the specify topic of population ageing and declining fertility with yearly trend will be analyzed on other policy issues by government. The analysis with yearly trend is used by the government to evaluate how to allocate research funding to the specify topic and it can be as the reference for decision of government in Taiwan. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

In ERBAC, the abstract concept of “permission” in RBAC96 is substituted by a set of “tasks”, mutual exclusion of basic business actions and mutual exclusion of roles are presented, and separation of duty (SoD) policy is defined formally. Furthermore, a method of identifying mutual exclusion of roles is described, and static SoD and dynamic SoD algorithms are discussed. This paper is significant for modeling and implementing business-oriented SoD policy for information systems. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Within a life-long interactive learning period, the agent, trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), must be able to handle natural conversations with human users, and achieve good learning performance (i.e. accuracy) while minimising human effort in the learning process. We train and evaluate this system in interaction with a simulated human tutor, which is built on the BURCHAK corpus - a Human-Human Dialogue dataset for the visual learning task. The results show that: 1) The learned policy can coherently interact with the simulated user to achieve the goal of the task (i.e. learning visual attributes of objects, e.g. colour and shape); and 2) it finds a better trade-off between classifier accuracy and tutoring costs than hand-crafted rule-based policies, including ones with dynamic policies. © 2017 Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Language Grounding for Robotics, RoboNLP 2017 at the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017.

Supervised deep learning and natural language processing potentially enable classification of these data but require high quality labeled inputs. This study investigates whether hybridizing rigorous qualitative coding methods with machine learning approaches can classify large amounts of policy-oriented text data (public comments) while keeping manual effort tractable. Using a convolutional neural network, we evaluate spatiotemporal variation in themes and expressed public attitudes toward a specific US climate policy, the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was proposed in 2014 and repealed in 2019 without ever taking effect. Public comments were solicited for both the proposal and proposed repeal across eight cities, representing a large and highly targeted dataset on dynamic public attitudes toward the CPP. Rigorous manual coding and data augmentation techniques enabled good model performance (F1 scores of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively, for sentiment and topic classification), even with a very small training set. We find that most speakers supported the CPP despite its eventual repeal and uncover notable rhetorical trends like competing narratives of justice for those affected by climate change versus fossil fuel host communities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These concerns have piqued the interest of researchers, who have advanced new approaches and theoretical insights to enhance data gathering, treatment and models’ training. Nonetheless, few works have looked at the trade-offs between appropriateness and accuracy in indicator evaluation to comprehend how these constraints and approaches may better redound into policymaking and have a more significant impact across culture and sustainability matters for urban governance. This empirical study fulfils this void by researching indicators’ accuracy and utilizing algorithmic models to test the benefits of large text-based analysis. Here we describe applied work in which we find affinity and occurrence in indicators trade-offs that result be significant in practice to evaluate large texts. In the study, objectivity and fairness are kept substantially without sacrificing accuracy, explicitly focusing on improving the processing of indicators to be truthfully assessed. This observation is robust when cross-referring indicators and unique words. The empirical results advance a novel form of large text analysis through machine intelligence and refute a widely held belief that artificial intelligence text processing necessitates either accepting a significant reduction in accuracy or fairness. © 2023, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

By simulating public opinion, ChatGPT shows promise in facilitating public policy development. However, challenges persist regarding its worldwide applicability and bias across demographics and themes. Our research employs socio-demographic data from the World Values Survey to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance in diverse contexts. Findings indicate significant performance disparities, especially when comparing countries. Models perform better in Western, English-speaking, and developed nations, notably the United States, in comparison to others. Disparities also manifest across demographic groups, showing biases related to gender, ethnicity, age, education, and social class. The study further uncovers thematic biases in political and environmental simulations. These results highlight the need to enhance LLMs’ representativeness and address biases, ensuring their equitable and effective integration into public opinion research alongside conventional methodologies. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research paper aims to explore the factors contributing to Ph.D. students' decision to dropout and their interrelationships. For this purpose, we employed the hybrid topic modeling Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers – Latent Dirichlet Allocation (BERT-LDA) algorithm and Numerical Association Rule Mining (NARM) using a genetic algorithm in QuantMiner. We identified and analyzed individual, institutional, and social factors that affect Ph.D. students in leaving their current degrees. The results suggest that financial constraints, inadequate academic preparation, poor mentoring, social isolation, lack of social support, family responsibilities, and work-life balance are significant elements responsible for dropout. These findings also reveal that these factors are interrelated, and their effects can be mitigated by the academic institution's policies and culture. The outcomes of the study have implications for academic institutions, policymakers, and researchers, who can use them to develop evidence-based strategies and interventions that enhance Ph.D. students' retention and success. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The following results were obtained. (1) A thematic cross-sectional analysis identified six core policy themes, namely, coordinated promotion of technology and finance, industry development and safety standardisation, market service and technical support systems, promotion strategy and urban cluster development, industrial capital and safety supervision mechanisms, and policy support and market expansion. The analysis also mapped the distribution of hot spots within these themes. (2) The keyword co-occurrence network of the NEV policy indicated that the network structure evolved from an initial ‘overall dispersion–theme concentration’, comprising 16 policy themes, to an ‘overall stability–theme coordination’, consisting of 14 policy themes. (3) The coordination degrees across the three types of policies exhibited a consistent upward spiral, with the comprehensive coordination index surging from 30 in 2007 to 951 in 2023, underscoring the complementary effects among policy instruments. These conclusions offer valuable insights for government departments to understand NEV development trends and dynamically adjust policy themes accordingly. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Tracking the development trajectory of offshore wind technology (OWT) becomes essential for maintaining competitiveness in the global market. While existing studies have explored OWT development through expert knowledge and qualitative methods, few have quantitatively examined its detailed evolution paths. This study proposes a novel macro-micro analysis framework leveraging patent text mining methods. The framework aims to uncover both the overall development patterns and detailed technical evolution paths of OWT, informing decisions across academia, policy, and industry. At the macro level, the analysis depicts global innovation trends, major patent applicants, and the distribution of technology categories. The tracking results reveal distinct regional innovation patterns and highlight the leading role of government in offshore wind development. At the micro level, the framework identifies the technical evolution paths across three major fields, revealing key R&D hotspots and lifecycle stages of sub-technical categories. Through systematic patent text mining and multi-level analysis, this study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of OWT development trajectory and provides evidence-based support for future technology planning and innovation strategies. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Participants can then engage in an act of moral cleansing that is either costly (donating part of the participation bonus) or costless (expressing an intention to sign a petition), and choose the beneficiary of the prosocial behavior. Sentiment analysis of the content of the recalls confirms that recalling an immoral behavior, independently of the domain, leads to more negative sentiment than recalling a neutral event. This effect is particularly strong when recalling an immoral behavior in the interpersonal domain. Recalling immoral behaviors in the interpersonal domain influenced the relative composition of donation versus petition behavior, but not the overall amount of prosocial behavior. In particular, it increases the probability of engaging in costly moral cleansing and reduces engagement in costless moral cleansing. However, when the immoral behavior is in the environmental domain, participants do not display even costless moral cleansing. Finally, we observe a preference for compensating in the same broad domain as the immoral behavior. Our results extend the understanding of moral cleansing and suggest some policy implications, especially advising against counting on the ability of pro-environmental morality to guide behavior. © 2022 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In order to fully explore the relationship between policy factors and load, and improve the accuracy of load forecasting, a quantitative method of power policy based on policy modeling consistency (PMC) index was proposed and it was applied to load forecasting. Firstly, the PMC evaluation system of electric power field was established, and then the PMC index of power policy text was obtained by text mining technology. Finally, the load forecasting model based on long shrot term memory was constructed. The quantitative index of power policy, weather, date and other influencing factors were input into the model, and compared with the model without considering policy factors. The experiment shows that the load forecasting model with policy factors achieves good results. After adding policy quantitative data, the error mean absolute percentage error of load forecasting model is reduced from 1.67 to 0.98, and mean absolute error is reduced from 28.97 to 19.68, which indicates that PMC model has a certain ability of policy quantification. © 2022 Chinese Journal of Intelligent Science and Technology.

Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, this article presents a case study employing sentiment analysis on unstructured social media data from Twitter (now X) to gauge public sentiment regarding pandemic-related restrictions. Our study aims to uncover and analyze Jamaican citizens’ emotions and opinions surrounding COVID-19 restrictions following an outbreak at a call center in April 2020. Machine learning sentiment analysis was used to analyze tweets from Twitter related to the lockdown. A total of 1 609 tweets were retrieved and analyzed, 76% of which expressed negative sentiments, suggesting that the majority of citizens were not in favor of the restrictions. The low compliance with the government-mandated policy may be related to the high percentage of negative sentiments expressed. Insights from citizens’ sentiments derived from open data sources such as Twitter can serve as valuable indicators for public health policymakers, providing critical input that will aid in tailoring interventions that align with public sentiments, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of and compliance with public health policies. This type of analysis can be useful to the health community and more generally to governments, as it allows for a more scientific assessment of public response to public health intervention techniques in real time. This study contributes to the emerging discourse on the integration of nontraditional data into public health policy-making, highlighting the growing potential for the use of these novel analytic techniques in addressing complex public health challenges. © 2024 Pan American Health Organization.

However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive application of this factor in oil price forecasting, primarily due to the complexity of measuring such policy evolutions. To address this research gap, this study develops a news-based OPEC+ policy index based on text mining methods for comprehensive analysis and forecasting of the oil price. First, by crawling and mining news headlines related to OPEC+ production decisions, a dynamic and high-frequency (weekly) OPEC+ policy index is established. Second, the linear and nonlinear relationship between the proposed OPEC+ policy index and the WTI crude oil futures price is thoroughly examined, assessing the potential predictive power of the index in explaining the movements of the crude oil price. Third, the forecasting efficacy of the constructed index on the oil price is rigorously evaluated across eight econometric and machine learning models. Key findings include: (1) The proposed weekly OPEC+ policy index demonstrates strong concordance with OPEC+ production change decisions, exhibiting notable peaks and troughs corresponding to OPEC+ Ministerial Meetings. (2) The relationship analysis demonstrates a strong linear and nonlinear association between the proposed OPEC+ policy index and the crude oil price. (3) For oil price prediction, models incorporating our proposed OPEC+ policy index demonstrate superior performance compared to models without this index. In particular, the index exhibits a more significant predictive effect within three-week forecasting horizons and performs exceptionally well during periods of pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In addition, the OPEC+ policy index also exhibits a significant predictive effect on the daily crude oil price and natural gas price, further confirming the robust and powerful forecasting capability of this index within the energy system. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Although researchers have designed methods to identify the conflict between app behavior and privacy policies, little is known about the privacy compliance issues relevant to third-party libraries (TPLs). The regulators enacted articles to regulate the usage of personal information for TPLs (e.g., the CCPA requires businesses clearly notify consumers if they share consumers' data with third parties or not). However, it remains challenging to investigate the privacy compliance issues of TPLs due to three reasons: 1) Difficulties in collecting TPLs' privacy policies. In contrast to Android apps, which are distributed through markets like Google Play and must provide privacy policies, there is no unique platform for collecting privacy policies of TPLs. 2) Difficulties in analyzing TPL's user privacy access behaviors. TPLs are mainly provided in binary files, such as jar or aar, and their whole functionalities usually cannot be executed independently without host apps. 3) Difficulties in identifying consistency between TPL's functionalities and privacy policies, and host app's privacy policy and data sharing with TPLs. This requires analyzing not only the privacy policies of TPLs and host apps but also their functionalities. In this paper, we propose an automated system named ATPChecker to analyze whether Android TPLs comply with the privacy-related regulations. We construct a data set that contains a list of 458 TPLs, 247 TPL's privacy policies, 187 TPL's binary files and 641 host apps and their privacy policies. Then, we analyze the bytecode of TPLs and host apps, design natural language processing systems to analyze privacy policies, and implement an expert system to identify TPL usage-related regulation compliance. The experimental results show that 23% TPLs violate regulation requirements for providing privacy policies. Over 47% TPLs miss disclosing data usage in their privacy policies. Over 65% host apps share user data with TPLs while 65% of them miss disclosing interactions with TPLs. Our findings remind developers to be mindful of TPL usage when developing apps or writing privacy policies to avoid violating regulations. © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The research addresses two primary questions: What are the prevailing sentiments toward remote work in the post-pandemic period, and how do these sentiments compare to initial reactions at the pandemic's onset? Using sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, the study analyzes tweets containing the keyword Remote Work.The findings reveal a strong positive sentiment towards remote work, with 63% of tweets classified as positive, reflecting the perceived benefits of flexibility, improved work-life balance, and broader job opportunities, especially in technology, management, and engineering roles. The LDA analysis identifies ten distinct themes, including the impact of remote work on education, health, public policy, and the job market. These insights underscore the importance of collaboration and team culture in sustaining effective remote and hybrid work environments. The study's findings are significant in highlighting the ongoing acceptance and adaptation to remote work, which is likely to shape the future of work in profound ways. However, the research also acknowledges its limitations, such as the reliance on a single social media platform and the potential biases in sentiment analysis. Future research should consider integrating data from multiple sources to provide a more comprehensive understanding of remote work dynamics.  © 2013 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Methods: By means of the text mining and literature research method, the Policy Modeling Consistency Index (PMC-index) model of CHI policies was constructed. The model was used to analyze the 22 policies individually and as a whole to describe the current situation of CHI policies in China. Results: The PMC-index model consisted of 10 primary variables and 41 secondary variables. This study found that the average PMC index of the 22 policies included is 7.48, suggesting that existing policies are generally of high quality. Among them, good policies accounted for 18.18%, and excellent policies accounted for 81.82%. Among the primary variables, X10 (policy disclosure) had the highest score, and the scores of other primary variables were ranked as X3 (policy recipients) > X5 (policy content) > X6 (policy tools) > X8 (cooperation and connection) > X7 (content evaluation) > X1 (policy nature) > X9 (policy goals) > X4 (policy incentives) > X2 (policy timeliness). Conclusions: At present, China’s CHI policies are generally at an excellent level. However, there is still room for improvement with regard to “policy incentives, policy goals, content evaluation, policy tools and policy content”.

The speed in disseminating reliable information and the subsequent guidelines and policy implementation are also essential to save as many lives as possible. Trustworthy guidelines should be based on a systematic evidence review which uses reproducible analytical methods to collect secondary data and analyse them. However, the guidelines’ drafting process is time consuming and requires a great deal of resources. This paper aims to highlight the importance of accelerating and streamlining the extraction and synthesis of scientific evidence, specifically within the systematic review process. To do so, this paper describes the COKE (COVID-19 Knowledge Extraction framework for next generation discovery science) Project, which involves the use of machine reading and deep learning to design and implement a semi-automated system that supports and enhances the systematic literature review and guideline drafting processes. Specifically, we propose a framework for aiding in the literature selection and navigation process that employs natural language processing and clustering techniques for selecting and organizing the literature for human consultation, according to PICO (Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) elements. We show some preliminary results of the automatic classification of sentences on a dataset of abstracts related to COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.

The mental health of readers and viewers can also be affected by the media after tragic events. Potentially, the media have a proactive role in shaping the actions of the mass population and thereby influencing policy actions. The print media especially are considered a key avenue for taking information to the masses. However, in this information and communications technology (ICT) era, people are increasingly reluctant to carry hard-copy newspapers, instead preferring e-newspapers. At the present time, entire newspapers, and especially their opinion sections, are deluged by concerns about the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. After China and Japan first encountered COVID-19, other Asian countries began their COVID-19 fight at different times between January and March 2020. All affected countries sought to manage the pandemic in their own way, following lessons learned from China and Japan. Every form of media in affected countries highlighted concerns by presenting news, perceptions, and opinions related to the pandemic. With opinion sections and editorials, the key sections of e-newspapers to reflect experts' perceptions and thoughts, this study aims to examine experts' views in the e-newspapers of five different countries in Asia, in relation to China and Japan. Considering the diversity of socioeconomic and geopolitical settings, five countries - South Korea, Singapore, Iran, India, and Bangladesh - are selected, each represented by one leading English-language e-newspaper. This study explores how experts' perceptions in the studied countries present different aspects of life. It also examines which e-newspaper emphasized which aspect of life and in which period of the outbreak. By intensive text mining in each selected e-newspaper, the study found that experts' opinions addressed diverse issues with regard to COVID-19. These issues are grouped under the following eight categories: health and drugs, preparedness and awareness, social welfare and humanity, the economy, governance and institutions, politics, the environment and wildlife, and innovation and technology. This pioneering study of five different e-newspapers in Asian countries from January to March 2020 presents a similar picture of experts' concerns and their roles in shaping responses to health crises; thus, it plays a role in contributing to policy actions.  © 2020 Parvin, Ahsan, Rahman and Abedin.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Future lifestyle changes in developed countries are expected to result in significant energy use reductions of up to 50% by 2050, with a correspondingly large impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, neither clear categorizations of behavioral or nontechnological (NT) climate mitigation solutions (CMS), nor corresponding estimates of global potentials for energy savings and GHG mitigation are available. Using a systematic map methodology, review of frameworks, and topic modeling, Results indicate a literature bias toward developed countries, we propose a taxonomy that conceptually covers various demands (maintained/reduced), perspectives (individual/collective), and direct energy use (yes/no), resulting in five types of NT solutions: active and passive management and operation (MO), demand flexibility, sufficient comfort levels, circular and sharing economy, and organizational and social innovations. A knowledge glut for active and passive MO has been identified, with clusters in Europe and North America. Furthermore, evidence gaps were discovered in terms of geographical scope (with very little literature available about Africa and the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia), stakeholder perspectives, and some measures (circular and sharing economy, flexibility of demand over time, social and organizational innovations). There was insufficient evidence on current NT CMS adoption and implementation costs. Quantified potentials were mostly found for developed countries and residential buildings, with more energy savings than GHG mitigation studies. Whereas these potentials are substantial, they vary largely among regions and solutions. The potential energy-saving ranges between 5% and 40% for most regions and CMS. The greatest potential GHG emissions reductions are seen in the circular and sharing category (25% to 70%). For other actions, most potentials range from 5% to 30%. More research is needed to provide evidence on rebound effects that can offset the climate benefits of NT solutions, business models that demonstrate their financial viability, and policy actions that trigger the already identified climate mitigation potentials of NT solutions. © 2021\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Forcing social animals to maintain physical distance has presented significant challenges for health authorities and law enforcement. Anecdotal media reports suggest widespread dissatisfaction with social distancing as a policy, yet there is little prior work aimed at measuring community acceptance of social distancing. In this paper, we propose a new approach to measuring attitudes towards social distancing by using social media and sentiment analysis. Over a four-month period, we found that 82.5 percent of tweets were in favour of social distancing. The results indicate a widespread acceptance of social distancing in a selected community. We examine options for estimating the optimal (minimal) social distance required at scale, and the implications for securing widespread community support and for appropriate crisis management during emergency health events. © 2020, A.S.M.

Ethical complexities surround AI, including privacy concerns, social deployment, and nonhuman decision-making. This project included English-language, peer-reviewed surveys and reviews published within the past five years. It also conducts topic modeling of one year's worth of social media data. Data were gathered from various academic databases and social media platforms and analyzed with topic modeling and sentiment analysis to provide external validation of insights into public sentiment and attitudes towards AI. Surveys and reviews worldwide revealed an understanding of AI concepts and positive sentiment toward AI integration in healthcare. Concerns persisted regarding data privacy, safety, and AI's impact on employment. Individual factors like age and education influence attitudes. Reviews mirrored survey findings with safety concerns about autonomous vehicles and calls for collaboration and regulation in clinical AI implementation. Social media discussions delved into AI's ethical, market, and policy implications, but Quora leaned more positively and Reddit more speculatively. Reviews, surveys, and social media provide insights into global attitudes toward AI, highlighting widespread understanding but persistent concerns. Collaboration, regulation, and ongoing education are essential for responsible AI integration across domains and regions to address privacy, security, and ethical concerns. Designers must prioritize transparency, accountability, and human-centered design to build trust and address public apprehensions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Traditional methods for gauging this sentiment, however, are limited in scalability and reproducibility over time. This paper reviews the application of sentiment analysis in energy research, highlighting its potential to overcome these limitations by providing large-scale, quantifiable data across diverse energy technologies and geographies. By showcasing integrations of sentiment analysis with topic modeling, this review showcases approaches that enhance the understanding of public opinions and support more informed policy-making. This paper finds that researchers have leveraged a wide range of data sources, including social media, news reports, research papers, and transcripts of interviews and speeches, but have often relied on suboptimal models to perform the sentiment classification. In line with existing literature, our quantitative model comparison indicates that transformer-based and large language model approaches can improve classification accuracy by up to 20% compared to traditional lexicon-based methods. In particular, this study is the first to compare GPT model performance in an energy context. To support future research, this review provides practical guidance on model selection in sentiment analysis, lowering the technical barrier to adoption. By encouraging broader use of sentiment analysis, this work aims to improve public response forecasting, facilitating the development of more effective energy policies and advancing energy technologies. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In response to this problem, this paper integrates the internet, public information, market credit information, and other data, uses hidden Markov models and natural language processing technology, and establishes a modern government public policy and public opinion monitoring and early warning model to evaluate government credit in real time; the government can formulate relevant policies based on the evaluation results to improve the government's governance capabilities. Empirical analysis shows that, based on the dynamic scoring framework and Markov model, the government credit monitoring and early warning models established, respectively, have 90% of the reference value, and the analysis results have the same reference. This method can effectively predict the trend of hot online public opinion. The subsequent establishment of an online public opinion early warning system and an online public opinion guidance mechanism provided theoretical support. © 2021 Zi Li.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, we examine a new avenue of bureaucratic response to politics—tone shifts in annual reporting. Specifically, we use sentiment analysis to gauge shifts in bureaucratic language after a change in party control of government in U.S. states. Our sample includes the text of reports from higher education agencies in five states over an extended period. We argue bureaucrats modify the framing of policy issues to appeal to the perspective of the party in power. The results further the notion that bureaucratic actors are acutely aware of and reactive to their political surroundings in a variety of ways, adding to the literature about bureaucrats as strategic actors. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Public opinion regarding COVID-19 can be processed to get a sentiment so that it is useful in making a decision or policy. In this study, sentiment analysis was done using a stacking method on Indonesian-language tweet data related to COVID-19. Sentistrength_id is used for sentiment labeling on tweet data that has been collected so that sentiment labels can be obtained in the form of positive and negative class. The sentiment analysis carried out on the tweet data resulted in a positive opinion class of 1879 and negative opinion of 1706. From these data the classification was done using stacking of naïve bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Regression as base learner and Support Vector Machine as meta learner. The classification result produce a value in accuracy, precision and recall of 85.6%, 86% and 86%, respectively.. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research aims to identify core topics in TIM studies and explore their dynamic changes. The conventional approach, based on discrete assignments by subjective judgment with predetermined categories, cannot effectively capture latent topics from large volumes of scholarly data. Hence, this study adopts the topic model approach, which automatically discovers topics that pervade a large and unstructured collection of documents, to uncover research topics in TIM research. The 50 topics of TIM research are identified through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model from 11,693 articles published from 1997 to 2016 in 11 TIM journals, and top 10 most popular topics in TIM research are briefly reviewed. We then explore topic trends by examining the changes in topics rankings over different time periods and identifying hot and cold topics of TIM research over the last two decades. For each of the 11 TIM journals, the areas of subspecialty and the effects of editor changes on topic portfolios are also investigated. The findings of this study are expected to provide implications for researchers, journal editors, and policy makers in the field of TIM. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the critical discourse on bridging the vast knowledge gap between experts who shape and implement standards for LLMs and users whose values are at stake remains largely unaddressed. Taking a “bottom-up” perspective and using a mixed-method approach, we first conducted interviews (N = 12) to engage with users’ perceptions of normative standards in the context of LLMs. We thereby identified 68 specific criteria that users’ consider when evaluating whether their values are fulfilled. Second, we conducted an online survey (N = 379) to further investigate how users prioritize these standards and the identified criteria in conversational LLM-based applications. Our findings reveal opportunities for strategic communication measures, the importance of transparent governance mechanisms and the necessity of non-technical complements to technical solutions for bridging the knowledge gap. We discuss actionable steps to effectively communicate trustworthy AI standards. Copyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In this paper, we retrieved all accessible texts related to K-12 CT education on the Quora platform. The textual data obtained ranged from June 2010 to September 2022. We then performed topic modeling analysis to identify major topics and uncover meaningful themes of the public responses to CT education initiatives. In general, people expressed positive comments about CT education. However, they were still concerned about the difficulties in learning and education equality for disadvantaged groups. In addition, since CT practices develop students' essential skills in the job market, people may overestimate the outcomes of CT education. Our findings provide insights into public perceptions of children’s CT education. The results of this study can facilitate education policymaking, curriculum design, and further research directions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper presents a classroom study to investigate this comparison in a college level Computer Science (CS) course where groups of students worked collaboratively to design database access strategies. Forty-four teams were randomly assigned to three reflection conditions ([GEN] directive to generate a contrasting case to the student solution and evaluate their trade-offs in light of the principle, [CONT] directive to compare the student solution with a provided contrasting case and evaluate their trade-offs in light of a principle, and [NSI] a control condition with a non-specific directive for reflection evaluating the student solution in light of a principle). In the CONT condition, as an illustration of the use of LLMs to exemplify knowledge transformation beyond knowledge construction in the generation of an automated contribution to a collaborative learning discussion, an LLM generated a contrasting case to a group's solution to exemplify application of an alternative problem solving strategy in a way that highlighted the contrast by keeping many concrete details the same as those the group had most recently collaboratively constructed. While there was no main effect of condition on learning based on a content test, low-pretest student learned more from CONT than GEN, with NSI not distinguishable from the other two, while high-pretest students learned marginally more from the GEN condition than the CONT condition, with NSI not distinguishable from the other two. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Reflection during or even in place of computer programming is beneficial for learning of principles for advanced computer science when the principles are new to students. Generation of contrasting cases and comparing contrasting cases have both been demonstrated to be effective as opportunities to learn from reflection in some contexts, though questions remain about ideal applicability conditions for adult learners. Intelligent conversational agents can be used effectively to deliver stimuli for reflection during collaborative learning, though room for improvement remains, which provides an opportunity to demonstrate the potential positive contribution of large language models (LLMs). What this paper adds The study contributes new knowledge related to the differences in applicability conditions between generation of contrasting cases and comparison across provided contrasting cases for adult learning. The paper presents an application of LLMs as a tool to provide contrasting cases tailored to the details of actual student solutions. The study provides evidence from a classroom intervention study for positive impact on student learning of an LLM-enabled intervention. Implications for practice and/or policy Advanced computer science curricula should make substantial room for reflection alongside problem solving. Instructors should provide reflection opportunities for students tailored to their level of prior knowledge. Instructors would benefit from training to use LLMs as tools for providing effective contrasting cases, especially for low-prior-knowledge students. © 2024 The Author(s).

Currently, consulting firms strive to use data to support client's business decisions with evidence. To be effective at this, consultants must consider the applicability of both internal and external data libraries to their clients' requirements. Frequently, evaluating the applicability of data sets is a manual process, which can be costly to the firm and the client. This paper describes a technical approach to automate this process. Specifically, it details the structure of a software application, named UVa Open Miner, capable of assessing the applicability of data sources to client projects. This UVa Open Miner aims to maximize the scale and diversity of candidate data sets, increase the relevance of data found, and maintain manageable computational complexity. UVa Open Miner consists of two segments: mapping and matching. The mapping component text mines web pages to identify an ontology of keywords describing the business requirement. This enables users to handle diverse business requirements from various industry verticals. The matching component scores data sets based on a relevance factor obtained from the ontology map. To validate the application, subject matter experts provided business requirements for a problem in their domain, and validated the application's results. Professionals in environment science, political science and policy-making fields found the application to be useful. Therefore, the application, along with the framework used, can be refactored into a reusable solution for consulting firms to use for their clients. © 2016 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Based on machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, personal data access and collection practices mentioned in app privacy policy text are analyzed to predict the required permission requests. Further, the predicted list of permission requests is compared with the real permission requests to check whether there is any mismatch. We further propose user interface designs to map mobile app permission requests to understandable language definitions for the end user. The combination of these concepts provides users with special knowledge about data protection practice and behavior of apps based on the analysis of privacy policy text and permission declaration which are otherwise difficult to analyze. Initial results demonstrate the capability of our approach in prediction of app permission requests. Also, by exploiting our already proposed app behavior analyzer tool, we investigated the correlation between what mobile apps do in reality and what they promise in their privacy policy text resulting in a positive correlation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Accordingly, EU's 2007-2013 Rural Development policy (RDP) is one framework to incorporate aspects labelled as quality of life (QOL) alongside traditional rural tenets. With a new rendition of the RDP underway, this paper scopes the content and extent of the expired RDP regarding its incorporation of QOL, in order to better identify considerations for future policy making. Using novel methodology called topic modelling, a series of latent semantic structures within the RDP could be unravelled and re-interpreted via a dual categorization system based on RDP's own view on QOL, and on definitions provided by independent research. Corroborated by other audits, the findings indicate a thematic overemphasis on agriculture, with the focus on QOL being largely insignificant. Such results point to a rationale different than the assumed one, at the same time reinforcing an outdated view of rurality in the face of the ostensibly fundamental turn towards viewing rural areas in a wider, more humanistic, perspective. This unexpected issue of underrepresentation is next addressed through three possible drivers: conceptual(lingering productionist view of the rural), ideological (capitalist prerogative preventing non-pecuniary values from entering policy) and material (institutional lock-ins incapable ofaccommodating significant deviations from an agricultural focus). The paper ends with a critical discussion and some reflections on the broader concept of rurality. © 2014 Nicolaus Copernicus University Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recently, massive new words are created and widely spread in social media, and they pose a great influence on sentiment analysis. Facing this situation, most previous work still just add those new words into sentiment lexicon, none of the existed researches focuses on the role and influence of new words in emotional expression. In this paper, we pay more attention to the influence of new words and propose two novel new words based sentiment analysis methods, named NWLb and NWSA, the former only with the help of lexicon and the latter further incorporates machine learning, which utilize the distinctive role of new words to improve the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in social media. Experiments on real social media dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of our methods. © 2016 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We present a supervised ensemble n-gram model for ideology extraction with topic adjustments and apply it to one such domain: research papers written by academic economists. We show economists' political leanings can be correctly predicted, that our predictions generalize to new domains, and that they correlate with public policy-relevant research findings. We also present evidence that unsupervised models can under-perform in domains where ideological expression is discouraged. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper introduces an emotion-based classification model to analyze the human behavior in reaction to some event described by a tweet trend. From tweets analysis, the model extracts terms expressing emotions, and then, it builds a topological space of emotion-based concepts. These concepts enable the training of the multi-class SVM classifier to identify emotions expressed in the tweets. Classifier results are “softly” interpreted as a blending of several emotional nuances which thoroughly depicts people’s feeling. An ontology model captures the emotional concepts returned by classification, with respect to the tweet trends. The associated knowledge base provides human behavior analysis, in response to an event, by a tweet trend, by SPARQL queries. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recent work has made progress in leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to automate privacy policy analysis and extract data collection statements from different sentences, considered in isolation from each other. In this paper, we view and analyze, for the first time, the entire text of a privacy policy in an integrated way. In terms of methodology: (1) we define POLIGRAPH, a type of knowledge graph that captures statements in a privacy policy as relations between different parts of the text; and (2) we develop an NLP-based tool, POLIGRAPH-ER, to automatically extract POLIGRAPH from the text. In addition, (3) we revisit the notion of ontologies, previously defined in heuristic ways, to capture subsumption relations between terms. We make a clear distinction between local and global ontologies to capture the context of individual privacy policies, application domains, and privacy laws. Using a public dataset for evaluation, we show that POLIGRAPH-ER identifies 40% more collection statements than prior state-of-the-art, with 97% precision. In terms of applications, POLIGRAPH enables automated analysis of a corpus of privacy policies and allows us to: (1) reveal common patterns in the texts across different privacy policies, and (2) assess the correctness of the terms as defined within a privacy policy. We also apply POLIGRAPH to: (3) detect contradictions in a privacy policy, where we show false alarms by prior work, and (4) analyze the consistency of privacy policies and network traffic, where we identify significantly more clear disclosures than prior work. © 2023 32nd USENIX Security Symposium, USENIX Security 2023.

Closing borders, limited supply and manpower, and continuous changes in regulations challenged many logistics firms to innovate. This study analyzes 5098 abstracts of logistics articles using text mining to identify and to quantify the changes in logistics trends and innovations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if these trends and innovations were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate that (1) resiliency is an ongoing trend in logistics and has shown increasing importance during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) there appears to be acceleration in digitalization trend in logistics based on emerging focus on blockchain, Internet of Things, data, drones, robots, and unmanned vehicles during COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) there seems to be no evidence of acceleration in sustainability due to COVID-19 despite an observed shift in sustainability trends in terms of bioenergy and biofuel before COVID-19 pandemic to low-carbon, hydrogen and electric vehicles during COVID-19 pandemic. This paper recommends logistics firms, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), to analyze their readiness to adopt digitalization in terms of data, resources, and technology via, e.g., the use of a maturity scan, to contribute to sustainable and resilient logistics and to make sure that they remain competitive and future-proof. Policy makers can provide support to these SMEs by providing information, funding, and template solutions. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In order to prevent fraudulent activities and protect the interests of the insurers, it is crucial to have an efficient fraud detection system in place. Traditional methods of fraud detection rely on rule-based or statistical techniques, which may not be effective enough to detect increasingly complex and sophisticated fraudulent activities. The advent of deep learning techniques offers a promising solution to this problem. Many domains, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and image recognition, have already seen the practical use of deep learning. In order to detect fraud in insurance claims data, deep learning has significant potential because of its capacity to learn from and adapt to huge and complicated datasets. Gathering and examining a vast amount of data is the initial stage in developing an intelligent analysis system for fraud detection in insurance claims data. Financial transactions, policy information, claimant information, historical claims records, and information from external data sources like social media and public records can all be included in this data. Following collection, the data is cleaned and preprocessed to make it ready for additional analysis.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Information privacy revolves around the fundamental principle of notice and choice, namely the idea that users should be able to make informed decisions about what information about them can be collected and how it can be used. Internet users want control over their privacy, but their choices are often hidden in long and convoluted privacy policy documents. Moreover, little (if any) prior work has been done to detect the provision of choices in text. We address this challenge of enabling user choice by automatically identifying and extracting pertinent choice language in privacy policies. In particular, we present a two-stage architecture of classification models to identify opt-out choices in privacy policy text, labelling common varieties of choices with a mean F1 score of 0.735. Our techniques enable the creation of systems to help Internet users to learn about their choices, thereby effectuating notice and choice and improving Internet privacy. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It will lay a firm foundation for making full use of the great value hidden in the policy texts. [Method/ process] Based on the LDA model and attention mechanism, this paper proposes an applicable and integrated framework of policy text representation and classification by using the improved TextRank model and LDA model to enhance the vectorization of policy texts, and using CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model to extract the connotation features of policy texts, so as to improve the effect and accuracy of policy text classification. [Result/ conclusion] The experiment shows that compared with the single CNN model or BiLSTM model, the model proposed in this paper has a higher accuracy in policy text classification, and the accuracy can be further promoted by using topic model to enhance the representation effect of policy texts. Moreover, with the addition of attention mechanism, the proposed framework achieved the highest performance, with the F1 score of 91. 11%. [Limitations] The functional attributes and structural features of the policy texts are not fully explored and used, and the imbalance of the categories of the policy texts is not considered. © 2021 Information studies: Theory and Application.

However, the effectiveness of these policies has yet to be fully explored. This study aims to explore the practical policy configurational conditions for achieving a high level of OSC development. Design/methodology/approach: Data on policy configurational conditions and the OSC development level were collected from 28 provinces/municipalities in China using text mining. A mixed-method approach was used to conduct data analysis involving text analysis and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Text analysis was used to identify current policies with frequencies as independent variables and obtain the proportion of OSC projects in new construction projects as the dependent variable. QCA is employed to analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions of policy conditions for the high-level development of OSC by exploring the complex causal relationships between policy configurational conditions and the OSC development level. Findings: Nine policies are obtained from the current policy framework for promoting OSC development using text analysis: industry supports, land policies, presale policies, reputation rewards, regulation controls, tax incentives, floor area rewards, financial subsidies, and loan subsidies. Four policy configurational conditions are identified that can achieve a high development level of OSC: three incentive-driven policy conditions with industry supports, presale policies, tax incentives, and floor area rewards as the core conditions, and one compulsory-driven policy conditions with land policies, financial supports, and loan supports as the core conditions using fuzzy set QCA. Moreover, our study found that a single policy cannot achieve a high level of OSC development as a necessary condition, and the policy configurational conditions that lead to high and nonhigh levels of OSC development are asymmetrical. Research limitations/implications: The study did not test the policy’s dynamic effects on the OSC development. A longitudinal study will be conducted to further identify the impact of policy on OSC implementation. Practical implications: It provides policymakers with four practical policy configurational conditions to promote OSC development and guides policymakers to optimize effective policies considering the interaction effects of effective policies such as industry supports, presale policies, tax incentives, and floor area rewards instead of their net effects. Originality/value: It contributes to the existing literature concerning the effects of policy on emerging technology (i.e. OSC) promotion by elucidating configurative effects rather than net effects. Meanwhile, it enriches the research on the antecedent conditions that affect the implementation of other emerging technologies in the architecture engineering and construction industry. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The complexity and scale of the problem require sophisticated tools and techniques to understand, model, and project future climate conditions. Artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to play a critical role in advancing our understanding of climate change and improving the accuracy of climate projections. ChatGPT can be used in a variety of ways to aid climate research, including in model parameterization, data analysis and interpretation, scenario generation, and model evaluation. This technology provides researchers and policy-makers with a powerful tool for generating and analyzing different climate scenarios based on a wide range of data inputs, and for improving the accuracy of climate projections. The author acknowledges asking chatGPT questions regarding its uses for Climate Change Research. Some of the uses that it states are possible now and some are potentials for the future.

Representative data from January to July 2024 were collected from Twitter and Weibo, and Python was used for analysis and visualization. Our findings reveal that public discussions about ChatGPT on Twitter and Weibo can be categorized into four consistent themes: technology, products, emotions and education. Among these, education emerged as the most frequently discussed theme. Sentiment analysis shows that both platforms are dominated by positive emotions, with Twitter having a slightly lower proportion (45.2%) compared to Weibo (54.5%). Negative (24.1%) and neutral (30.7%) sentiments on Twitter are marginally higher than those on Weibo (19.9% and 25.6%, respectively). These findings significantly update the previous studies, particularly those suggesting the Chinese public held predominantly negative attitudes toward ChatGPT. Our research also offers valuable insights for policymakers, global technology companies and educators. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. Objective: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (corona, 2019-nCov, and COVID-19), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. Results: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). Conclusions: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

In this paper we propose a fully automatic and semantic method for filtering/searching bibliographic data, which allows users to look for information by specifying simple keyword queries or document queries, i.e. by simply submitting existing documents to the system. The limitations of standard techniques, based on either syntactical text search and on manually assigned descriptors, are overcome by considering the semantics intrinsically associated to the document/query terms; to this aim, we exploit different kinds of external knowledge sources (both general and specific domain dictionaries or thesauri). The proposed techniques have been developed and successfully tested for agricultural bibliographic data, which play a central role to enable researchers and policy makers to retrieve related agricultural and scientific information by using the AGROVOC thesaurus. © The Author(s) 2015.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We collected three immigration-related datasets (i.e., social media posts, news media headlines, and policy documents covering the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic that also marked the last year of the Trump presidency) and applied manual coding, automated text analysis, and time series modeling to analyze the relationships. The results show that news media set the public agenda across Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube at the second level, with conservative media elevating travel-related discussion and liberal media driving border- and court-rulings-related discussion on those platforms. Compared to news media, the second-level agenda-setting effect of policy announcements was small and platform-specific. Among the three platforms, public discourse on YouTube was the most responsive to media and policy agendas. These findings advance second-level agenda-setting research, demonstrate partisan differences in news media’s impact, reveal the limited role of public policy, and provide a nuanced portrayal of cross-platform public discourse dynamics. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

One important development in advancing the empirical study of international re-lations (IR) theory, therefore, is the availability of machine-Analyzable speech data. A collection of fine-grained textual representations of states speeches in the context of an important international organization, such as the United Na-tions General Assembly (UNGA), is needed to understand the ideas, preferences, and values that states put forth in their statements. An especially promising use for such a corpus of texts would be to measure states preferences based on their statements. In an effort to add to the burgeoning field of text-As-data in IR, I present the UNGA Speech Corpus, a collection of over 34,000 speeches delivered by states in the UNGA from 1993 to 2018. I use it to im-prove on recent work that links text to preferences in IR by combining a structural topic model with locally trained word embeddings to estimate the policy positions of states on specific topics. I then show how these topic scorescan help scholars to improve their analyses of exigent international issues, such as global climate change governance. © 2024 Oxford University Press.

Although reinforcement learning methods can largely ease human effort, it’s challenging to design reward functions for real-world tasks, especially for high-dimensional robotic control, due to complex relationships among joints and tasks. Recent advancements large language models (LLMs) enable automatic reward function design. However, approaches evaluate reward functions by retraining policies from scratch placing an undue burden on the reward function, expecting it to be effective throughout the whole policy improvement process. We argue for a more practical strategy in robotic autonomy, focusing on refining existing policies with policy-dependent reward functions rather than a universal one. To this end, we propose a novel reward-policy co-evolution framework where the reward function and the learned policy benefit from each other’s progressive on-the-fly improvements, resulting in more efficient and higher-performing skill acquisition. Specifically, the reward evolution process translates the robot’s previous best reward function, descriptions of tasks and environment into text inputs. These inputs are used to query LLMs to generate a dynamic amount of reward function candidates, ensuring continuous improvement at each round of evolution. For policy evolution, our method generates new policy populations by hybridizing historically optimal and random policies. Through an improved Bayesian optimization, our approach efficiently and robustly identifies the most capable and plastic reward-policy combination, which then proceeds to the next round of co-evolution. Despite using less data, our approach demonstrates an average normalized improvement of 95.3% across various high-dimensional robotic skill learning tasks.

However, training such models requires expensive annotation of complex structures, which hinders their adoption. Learning to actively-learn (LTAL) is a recent paradigm for reducing the amount of labeled data by learning a policy that selects which samples should be labeled. In this work, we examine LTAL for learning semantic representations, such as QA-SRL. We show that even an oracle policy that is allowed to pick examples that maximize performance on the test set (and constitutes an upper bound on the potential of LTAL), does not substantially improve performance compared to a random policy. We investigate factors that could explain this finding and show that a distinguishing characteristic of successful applications of LTAL is the interaction between optimization and the oracle policy selection process. In successful applications of LTAL, the examples selected by the oracle policy do not substantially depend on the optimization procedure, while in our setup the stochastic nature of optimization strongly affects the examples selected by the oracle. We conclude that the current applicability of LTAL for improving data efficiency in learning semantic meaning representations is limited. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, there is much less knowledge on efficient and effective methods and practices for public sector citizensourcing in comparison with private sector crowd-sourcing, so extensive research is required in this area. This paper contributes to filling this research gap, by presenting an ICT-based method for ‘passive expert-sourcing’, with the latter term denoting the collection of policy relevant information, knowledge and ideas from experts, which aims at supporting policy making by the European Union (EU) by leveraging its large policy community. Its theoretical foundation is previous theoretical work on the relationships between democracy and technocracy, and also on policy networks. The main technological pillars of the proposed method are: EU policy experts’ profiling and reputation management, relevant documents’ opinion mining and relevance rating, and finally advanced visualized presentation of them. Finally, a first evaluation of the proposed method is presented, leading to encouraging results. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

By criticising the validity of the concept of multivectorism, this article supports the hypothesis of Uzbekistani foreign policy and interests being reimagined and reshaped by engagement with domestic, and external actors. After a reflection on the role of language and ideas in political analysis, I will employ a Structural Topic Model to test the hypothesis empirically. The findings will support the hypothesis and the use of big data to provide a less biased analysis of foreign policy trends. © 2023 Maracchione.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This dataset, spanning 21 years with daily granularity, provides a unique view of the evolving social network between licensed professionals and their affiliated firms in Hong Kong’s financial sector. Leveraging large language models, we classify firms (e.g., asset managers, banks) and infer the likely nationality and gender of employees based on their names. This application enhances the dataset by adding rich demographic and organizational context, enabling more precise network analysis. Our preliminary findings reveal key structural features, offering new insights into the dynamics of Hong Kong’s financial landscape. We release the structured dataset to enable further research, establishing a foundation for future studies that may inform recruitment strategies, policy-making, and risk management in the financial industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Theoretically, parties may either adapt their ideological “core” to signal commitment or merely attribute nativist ideas to secondary issue areas to signal general responsiveness. Drawing on Austrian, German, and Swiss manifestos for over two decades and establishing a novel dictionary to assess parties’ use of nativism, we find that while previous studies showing right-wing parties compete with RRPs using nativism in the same domains are correct, the strategic choices around this competition are more complex. How much commitment to nativist ideas parties show depends on whether radical right parties use the same domains to construct their nativist claims. For research on party competition, this means that more attention should be paid to how rather than if parties “engage” with their rivals. © The Author(s) 2022.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study employs the structural topic model (STM) to analyze 139 AI policies from China, the European Union (EU), and the United States (US), three key actors in global AI governance. The analysis identifies 13 primary topics within AI policy frameworks, which are categorized into “research and application” (e.g., talent education, industrial application), “social impact” (e.g., technological risk, human rights), and “government role” (e.g., government responsibility, management agency). Notably, “government role” receives the most attention, while “social impact” is the least emphasized. The findings reveal that China prioritizes “research and application,” the EU emphasizes “social impact,” and the US focuses on “government role,” while all three demonstrate a growing emphasis on institutional systems, human rights, and scientific research. This study provides a comprehensive policy framework for AI governance, highlights the strategic priorities of China, the EU, and the US, and introduces an innovative method for policy text analysis. Moreover, it underscores the need for AI governance to balance industry development with ethical imperatives, foster comprehensive technological ecosystems, and prioritize public participation and international cooperation. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Navigating the complexities of public health communication during this crisis has emerged as a paramount challenge for both governmental institutions and media entities. In response to this quandary, we executed an extensive analysis of 929 official Chinese reports pertaining to COVID-19 on social media platforms, spanning from 7 November 2022, to 7 January 2023. Utilizing the sophisticated methodology of Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN), we discerned three overarching frameworks (Social Health Resources, Official Public Health Actions, and Dissemination of Health Knowledge) and nine salient themes (Medical Infrastructure, Collective Public Health Initiatives, Epidemiological Trajectories, Governmental Health Interventions, Temporary Recesses, Public Health Regulations, Community-Based Public Health, Medical Supply Distribution, and Health Information Dissemination). Moreover, by juxtaposing media coverage before and after the Chinese government’s adjustment in epidemic policy, we unveiled substantial disparities in the framing and thematic foci among various tiers and genres of media outlets. Our findings illuminate the intricate nature of public health reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic and underscore the necessity for a judicious appraisal of diverse factors. © 2024 Asian Media Information and Communication Centre.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An Analysis of Online Reviews\n                    ABSTRACT: In this paper, we aim to explore the impact of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic on the global tourism industry and the changes in users' online reviews of listings on the Airbnb platform in this context. As a result of the outbreak, countries have introduced travel restriction policies to limit the movement of people and control the spread of the epidemic, which has dealt a severe blow to the global tourism industry. We want to provide an in-depth study of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the tourism industry, as well as to explore the changes in the focus and attention of users on the travel experience. This is informative for tourism industry practitioners and policy makers to help better understand market demand and develop more rational policies. We selected online reviews on the Airbnb platform to explore the industry impact of the epidemic. Through topic modeling and sentiment analysis, this paper investigates the changes in users' discussion focus and attention level before, during and after the epidemic, and explores the reasons for them. The results show that the number of non-local visitors plummeted during the epidemic, while visitors paid more attention to topics related to environmental hygiene and personal health. In addition, this paper finds that user reviews have a very clear positive bias. From the triple perspective of platform, hosts, and users, this paper explores the reasons behind the phenomenon.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Use said pipeline to analyze mental health trends on subreddits frequented by pregnant women and report on interesting insights that could be helpful for policy-makers, clinicians, etc. Materials and methods: We used pretrained transformer-based models to build a natural language processing pipeline that can automatically detect depressed pregnant women on social media and carry out topic modeling to detect their concerns. Results: We detected depressed posts by pregnant women on Reddit and validated the performance of the depression classification model by carrying out topic modeling to reveal that depressive topics were detected. The proportion of potentially depressed surprisingly reduced during the pandemic (2020 and 2021). Queries related to antidepressants, such as Zoloft, and potential ways of managing mental health dominated discourse before the pandemic (2018 and 2019), whereas queries about pelvic pain and associated stress dominated the discourse during the pandemic. Discussion and Conclusion: Supportive online communities could be a factor in alleviating stress related to the pandemic, hence the reduction in the proportion of depressed users during the pandemic. Stress during the pandemic has been associated with pelvic pain among pregnant women, and this trend is confirmed through topic modeling of depressive posts during the pandemic.  © 2023 The Author(s).

The author’s stance could be in “favor” or “against” the topic under consideration. A myriad amount of data is being accumulated via various social media platforms. This work considers the Kannada–English code-mixed aspect of social media text. The corpus was collected based on various trending topics such as “Bengaluru molestation,” “currency ban”, etc. using particular word phrases. The user comments on social media platform Facebook was used to collect the corpus. The collected dataset was represented using different techniques such as bag of tricks, word embedding like Word2vec and GloVe, and pre-trained embeddings. These representations were further used in combination with various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The results for various combinations are listed. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This also includes informing users about any choices they might have regarding such data practices. However, few users read these often long privacy policies; and those who do have difficulty understanding them, because they are written in convoluted and ambiguous language. A promising approach to help overcome this situation revolves around semi-automatically annotating policies, using combinations of crowdsourcing, machine learning and natural language processing. In this article, we introduce PrivOnto, a semantic framework to represent annotated privacy policies. PrivOnto relies on an ontology developed to represent issues identified as critical to users and/or legal experts. PrivOnto has been used to analyze a corpus of over 23,000 annotated data practices, extracted from 115 privacy policies of US-based companies. We introduce a collection of 57 SPARQL queries to extract information from the PrivOnto knowledge base, with the dual objective of (1) answering privacy questions of interest to users and (2) supporting researchers and regulators in the analysis of privacy policies at scale. We present an interactive online tool using PrivOnto to help users explore our corpus of 23,000 annotated data practices. Finally, we outline future research and open challenges in using semantic technologies for privacy policy analysis. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Methods: After collecting nurse-related news articles published before and after ‘the Thanks to You Challenge’ campaign (between December 31, 2019, and July 15, 2020), keywords were extracted via preprocessing. A three-step method keyword analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, and keyword network analysis was used to examine the text and the structure of the selected news articles. Results: Top 30 keywords with similar occurrences were collected before and after the campaign. The five dominant topics before the campaign were: Pandemic, infection of medical staff, local transmission, medical resources, and return of overseas Koreans. After the campaign, the topics ‘infection of medical staff’ and ‘return of overseas Koreans’ disappeared, but ‘the Thanks to You Challenge’ emerged as a dominant topic. A keyword network analysis revealed that the word of nurse was linked with keywords like thanks and campaign, through the word of sacrifice. These words formed interrelated domains of ‘the Thanks to You Challenge’ topic. Conclusion: The findings of this study can provide useful information for understanding various issues and social perspectives on COVID-19 nursing. The major themes of news reports lagged behind the real problems faced by nurses in COVID-19 crisis. While the press tends to focus on heroism and whole society, issues and policies mutually beneficial to public and nursing need to be further explored and enhanced by nurses. © 2021 Korean Society of Nursing Science.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In the process of grouping the thesis title automatically it is hoped that it can help policy makers such as the head of the study program. In this case the researcher uses fuzzy c-means algorithm which can group data in clusters so that the data of a cluster has a high level of equality with each other. In the application there is a text mining method which is a development of data mining that can be applied to overcome thesis grouping problems or research data. The result is a web that can classify research data / thesis data with a total accuracy of 96%. This number is the accuracy given based on the performance of the fuzzy c-means algorithm on the system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, such strong ability relies on a huge amount of computing resources, which makes it difficult to deploy LLMs on computing resource-constrained platforms. Currently, LLMs process each token equivalently, but we argue that not every word is equally important. Some words should not be allocated excessive computing resources, particularly for dispensable terms in simple questions. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic inference paradigm for LLMs, namely D-LLMs, which adaptively allocate computing resources in token processing. We design a dynamic decision module for each transformer layer that decides whether a network unit should be executed or skipped. Moreover, we tackle the issue of adapting D-LLMs to real-world applications, specifically concerning the missing KV-cache when layers are skipped. To overcome this, we propose a simple yet effective eviction policy to exclude the skipped layers from subsequent attention calculations. The eviction policy not only enables D-LLMs to be compatible with prevalent applications but also reduces considerable storage resources. Experimentally, D-LLMs show superior performance, in terms of computational cost and KV storage utilization. It can reduce up to 45% computational cost and KV storage on Q&A, summarization, and math solving tasks, 50% on commonsense reasoning tasks. © 2024 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We study how specialization translates in the phenomenon of “epistemic capture” in democratic politics. We combine topic modeling, network analysis and community detection to complement lexical “distant reading” approaches the history of political ideas with a network-based analysis that illuminates political-intellectual processes. We demonstrate how the breadth of political debate declines as its specialist depth increases. To study this transformation, we take a multi-level approach. At the (institutional) macro-level, network modularity shows an increase in the modularity of topic linkage networks, indicating growing specialization post-1960, linked to institutional reforms. At the (political) meso-level, we similarly observe specialization in node neighborhood stability, but also variation as the consequence of ideological and party political change. Lastly, micro-level analysis reveals persistent thematic communities tied to increasingly stable groups of individuals, revealing how policy domains and politicians are captured in ossified specialisms. As such, this study provides new insights into the development of twentieth-century political debate and emergent tensions between pluralism and specialism. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This has highlighted the need to reduce harvest and post-harvest losses in the most vulnerable low to middle-income countries. The research and international community have actively engaged on the conceptual frameworks underpinning FLW, on the measurement approaches and the policy interventions to reduce FLW. Critical information gaps and data needs are evident. This paper using as a base the main conceptual frameworks proposed for measurement of FLW and existing quantitative evidence, attempts to sketch out a number of steps for gathering internationally comparable policy-relevant information. It presents quantitative evidence from a meta-analysis based on a machine learning text-mining tool, which is used to reassess a global percentage of losses with an emphasis on low and middle-income countries. Findings show that: i) losses for perishable crops, such as fruits and vegetables, display a median of 6.4 percent compared to 2.7–3.8 percent for other crops; ii) losses are higher in low-middle income regions, with 10–15 percent median losses, for example, for fruits and vegetables, compared to 4–7 percent for Europe and North America; iii) significant information gaps remain and the comparison of results across countries or even between sectors within them remains challenging. Acknowledging that some of these gaps are the result of insufficient coordination between different initiatives, this paper proposes operational frameworks to improve synergies and coordination in the measurement of FLW, in support of stakeholders’ decision making for reducing FLW. © 2020\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For a robot to perform tasks such as pick and place, understanding both what the objects are and where they are located is crucial. While the former has been extensively discussed in the literature that uses the large language model to enrich the text descriptions, the latter remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce the Object-Centric Instruction Augmentation (OCI) framework to augment highly semantic and information-dense language instruction with position cues. We utilize a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to weave knowledge of object locations into natural language instruction, thus aiding the policy network in mastering actions for versatile manipulation. Additionally, we present a feature reuse mechanism to integrate the vision-language features from off-the-shelf pre-trained MLLM into policy networks. Through a series of simulated and real-world robotic tasks, we demonstrate that robotic manipulator imitation policies trained with our enhanced instructions outperform those relying solely on traditional language instructions. © 2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In particular, sentiment analysis classifies a text into positive, negative, or neutral. It does not capture the state of mind of an individual like happiness, anger, and fear. Therefore, emotion detection plays an important role in user-generated content for capturing the state of mind. Moreover, researchers adopted traditional machine learning and deep learning models to capture emotions from the text. Recently, transformers-based architectures achieve better results in various natural language processing tasks. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based emotion detection system, which uses context-dependent features and a one-cycle learning rate policy for a better understanding of emotions from the text. We evaluate the proposed emotion detection model using error matrix, learning curve, precision, recall, F1-score, and their micro and macro averages. Our results indicate that the system achieves a 6 % accuracy over existing models. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, its resource-intensive nature necessitates strategic integration of renewable energy and optimization strategies to mitigate environmental impacts. This review is critical as it systematically examines the transformative role of metaverse technologies in energy systems, identifying their potential to optimize efficiency, foster innovation, and align with global sustainability objectives. This paper employs a rigorous methodology, integrating the PRISMA framework, machine learning-based BERTopic modeling, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) mapping algorithms to provide a structured synthesis of current research. The review is based on 4951 documents from the Scopus database, refined through a three-stage selection process, yielding a final dataset of 508 relevant publications. Through this analysis, six key themes emerge where metaverse technologies significantly impact energy systems: (1) advancing sustainability in transport, manufacturing, and nuclear power, supporting SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure); (2) enabling sustainable energy transitions through smart grids and AI-driven models, aligning with SDG 7's goal of universal clean energy access and SDG 13 (Climate Action), which integrates climate resilience into energy strategies. Additionally, innovations in battery technologies and immersive solutions for nuclear sustainability further demonstrate the metaverse's role in driving sustainable energy applications. This study makes a novel contribution by advancing the understanding of the metaverse-energy sustainability nexus through a systematic, data-driven approach, distinguishing itself from prior reviews by integrating topic modeling and SDG mapping. The findings highlight the need for strategic adoption, policy frameworks, and investment in sustainable design to ensure the metaverse's positive impact on global energy systems. Future research should focus on advancing digital twins, immersive technologies, and renewable energy integration to enhance efficiency, equity, and resilience in energy applications. © 2025 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Some might induce harsh measures, such as a lockdown. Following a long, harsh lockdown, the recession forces policymakers to rethink reopening. To provide an effective strategy, here we propose a control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals’ propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision-makers to find optimal lockdown and exit strategies for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized. We use the public sentiment information during the pandemic to determine the percentage of individuals with high-risk behavior and the percentage of individuals with low-risk behavior. Hence, we propose an online platform using fear-sentiment information to estimate the personal protective equipment (PPE) burn rate overtime for the entire population. In addition, a study of a COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is performed to validate our model and its results. The total social cost reduces by 18% compared with a control strategy where susceptible individuals are assumed to be homogeneous. We also reduce the total social costs by 26% and 22% compared to other strategies that consider the health-care cost or the social performance cost, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, these advancements come with substantial energy costs. The training and deployment of LLMs require extensive computational resources, leading to escalating energy consumption and environmental impacts. This paper explores the driving factors behind the high energy demands of LLMs through the lens of the Technology Environment Organization (TEO) framework, assesses their ecological implications, and proposes sustainable strategies for mitigating these challenges. Specifically, we explore algorithmic improvements, hardware innovations, renewable energy adoption, and decentralized approaches to AI training and deployment. Our findings contribute to the literature on sustainable AI and provide actionable insights for industry stakeholders and policymakers. © 2024 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The first concerns how we think about the training of such models - in particular, whether the creators or owners of the data that are scraped(lawfully or unlawfully, with or without permission) should be compensated for that use. The second question revolves around the ownership of the output generated by AI, which is continually improving in quality and scale. These topics fall in the realm of intellectual property, a legal framework designed to incentivize and reward only human creativity and innovation. For some years, however, Britain has maintained a distinct category for computer-generatedoutputs; on the input issue, the EU and Singapore have recently introduced exceptions allowing for text and data mining or computational data analysis of existing works. This article explores the broader implications of these policy choices, weighing the advantages of reducing the cost of content creation and the value of expertise against the potential risk to various careers and sectors of the economy, which might be rendered unsustainable. Lessons may be found in the music industry, which also went through a period of unrestrained piracy in the early digital era, epitomized by the rise and fall of the file-sharing service Napster. Similar litigation and legislation may help navigate the present uncertainty, along with an emerging market for legitimatemodels that respect the copyright of humans and are clear about the provenance of their own creations.  © 2024 The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Creating sufficient technological diversity among its alternatives is important for the long-term success of nanotechnologies, as well as for other emerging technologies. Diversity prevents early lock-in, facilitates recombinant innovation, increases resilience, and allows market growth. Creation of new technological alternatives usually takes place in innovation projects in which public and private partners often collaborate. Currently, there is little empirical evidence about which characteristics of innovation projects influence diversity. In this paper we study the influence of characteristics of EU-funded nanotechnology projects on the creation of technological diversity. In addition to actor diversity and the network of the project, we also include novel variables that have a plausible influence on diversity creation: the degree of multi-disciplinarity of the project and the size of the joint knowledge base of project partners. We apply topic modelling (Latent Dirichlet allocation) as a novel method to categorize technological alternatives. Using an ordinal logistic regression model, our results show that the largest contribution to diversity comes from the multi-disciplinary nature of a project. The joint knowledge base of project partners and the geographical distance between them were positively associated with technological diversity creation. In contrast, the number and diversity of actors and the degree of clustering showed a negative association with technological diversity creation. These results extend current micro-level explanations of how the diversity of an emerging technology is created. The contribution of this study could also be helpful for policy makers to influence the level of diversity in a technological field, and hence to contribute to survival of emerging technologies. © 2017, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper reveals policy gaps hindering SI-FLR approach in Brazil and offers recommendations to leverage its advancement, incorporating insights from the Brazilian context and international best practices and experiences. Brazilian policy documents in force in 2022 were analysed through the lens of five conceptual bridges of the SI-FLR framework. Applying a deductive approach and text-mining techniques, 91 SI-FLR-enabling policy instruments were identified, and the governance structures ruling them were mapped. Four major gaps emerged: (1) a lack of political will for the environmental agenda; (2) poor political coordination, resulting from the fragmentation of the mapped governance structures; (3) a missing landscape governance approach, reflecting the disconnection between these structures, restoration activities and value chains associated; and (4) a citizen science gap in innovation policy, highlighting the insufficiency of instruments promoting collaboration between public research and innovation institutions and local communities to address local social challenges. We conclude with two strategic recommendations: (1) structuring a National Landscape Restoration Governance System dedicated to improving policy coordination and landscape governance and (2) developing a regulatory instrument bringing citizen science to the research and innovation policy, increasing collaborative partnerships, innovation policy instruments and encouraging socioecological innovators. These recommendations represent a first step towards leveraging SI in the Brazilian FLR effort and may inspire other countries to expand the role of social innovators in developing nature-based solutions. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Data were collected via Text mining; frequency, association, and sentiment analysis using the social big data analysis service, (known as “Some-Trend”), 2 months before and after December 16, 2021, when the vaccine pass was announced. The total number of search results was 4899 occurrences of the keywords using “eating alone” and “Hon-bab” (Korean abbreviation for eating alone). During the week of December 16, the frequency was the highest (770 occurrences). Compared to the weeks before the announcement sentiment analysis shows that words including “Reject,” “Discrimination,” and “Uncomfortable,” among others, either newly appeared or increased in frequency. And also, the percentage of positive words decreased from 54.5% to 34% and that of negative words increased from 30.2% to 43.3%. The introduction of the vaccine pass has raised negative public interest, particularly regarding the policy of unvaccinated people forcefully restricted to eat alone. Accordingly, this study showed that the vaccine policy had not gain positive perception of the public. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In an effort to improve public understanding, we curated a corpus of 543 misinformation pieces whittled down to 243 unique misinformation narratives along with third party proofs debunking these stories. Building upon previous applications of topic modeling to COVID-19 related material, we developed a tool leveraging topic modeling to create a chronological visualization of these stories. From our corpus of misinformation stories, this tool has shown to accurately represent the ground truth reported by our curator team. This highlights some of the misinformation narratives unique to the COVID-19 pandemic and provides a quick method to monitor and assess misinformation diffusion, enabling policymakers to identify themes to focus on for communication campaigns. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

Because of its importance, lots of researches have come out. Recently, the neural generative models have shown their impressive ability as the core of chatbot, while it cannot scale well when directly applied to medical conversation due to the lack of medical-specific knowledge. To address the limitation, a scalable medical knowledge-assisted mechanism (MKA) is proposed in this paper. The mechanism is aimed at assisting general neural generative models to achieve better performance on the medical conversation task. The medical-specific knowledge graph is designed within the mechanism, which contains 6 types of medical-related information, including department, drug, check, symptom, disease, and food. Besides, the specific token concatenation policy is defined to effectively inject medical information into the input data. Evaluation of our method is carried out on two typical medical datasets, MedDG and MedDialog-CN. The evaluation results demonstrate that models combined with our mechanism outperform original methods in multiple automatic evaluation metrics. Besides, MKA-BERT-GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance.  © 2021 Ke Liang et al.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In particular, we investigate how objectives vary across central and local Five-Year Plans (FYPs), in terms of industry preferences, and also compare such objectives with those included in China’s landmark industrial policy, “Made in China 2025.” Notwithstanding China’s centralization of policy planning, we find relevant sectoral differences between central and provincial planning and key industrial policy documents. Secondly, we look at how decisions are made in the realm of China’s industrial policy (“deeds”). To this end, we assess empirically why certain companies are selected under the most recent grand industrial policy strategy, the 10,000 Little Giants, a spin-off of “Made in China 2025.” Out of the key four criteria of selection (i.e., “words”), one is missed in most cases, namely the concentration of the business activity in the relevant sector. Secondly, the intensity of R&D is only significant in the most recent batches of selected companies. For the last two (revenue generation and leverage), there is no noticeable difference between the selected companies and the others. Our results point to the complexities in conducting industrial policy in China as words and deeds do not necessarily align. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Emotional responses to scientific findings often play a pivotal role in these core issues. When there is too much diversity of opinion on topics of science, emotions flare up and give rise to conflict. This conflict threatens positive outcomes for research. Emotions have the power to shape how people process new information. They can color the public's understanding of science, motivate policy positions, even change lives. And yet little work has been done to evaluate the public's emotional response to science using quantitative methods. In this paper, we use a dataset of responses to scholarly articles on Facebook to analyze the dynamics of emotional valence, intensity, and diversity. We present a novel way of weighting click-based reactions that increases their comprehensibility, and use these weighted reactions to develop new metrics of aggregate emotional responses. We use our metrics along with LDA topic models and statistical testing to investigate how users' emotional responses differ from one scientific topic to another. We find that research articles related to gender, genetics, or agricultural/environmental sciences elicit significantly different emotional responses from users than other research topics. We also find that there is generally a positive response to scientific research on Facebook, and that articles generating a positive emotional response are more likely to be widely shared-a conclusion that contradicts previous studies of other social media platforms. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These legal documents govern the exchange, access, and dissemination of farm data and are expected to provide legal protection against misuse of data. Despite their significant influence on farm data processing and governance, there is limited understanding of the content of farm data license agreements and standards for drafting them. Although online privacy policy content has been extensively studied, farm data agreements’ evaluation and analysis have been overlooked. This study aims to investigate the structure, content, and transparency of farm data licenses. We collected 141 agricultural terms of use agreements and used natural language processing methods such as keyword and keyphrase analysis to perform text feature analysis, Flesch Readability Ease Score and Flesch Grade Level readability analysis, transparency analysis, and content analysis to gain insight into common data practices adopted by the agriculture technology providers. We also manually reviewed these agreements to validate the results and strengthen the observations. The findings show that data agreements are long, complex, and difficult to read and comprehend. The results suggest that 95% of the agreements fall under the difficult-to-read category and close to 75% of the policies require university-level education to understand the content. Furthermore, it is noted that some of the data management practices are not given adequate attention and are not as frequently mentioned in the agreements as expected. Finally, our analysis enabled us to provide recommendations on the content of farm data license agreements and strategies to improve them. © 2023 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For each modification recorded, DiCo provides additional information on the microstructural level, such as the linguistic labels included in the article where the change occurred. Based on a manual comparison of the successive editions of a given dictionary, DiCo can be the starting point for quantitative and qualitative metalexicographical studies. The description of the diachronic evolution of a dictionary and the comparison of different dictionaries reveal that not only does lexicographical change reflect language evolution, but that the content of a dictionary is also bound to the editorial policy of a publishing house, itself subject to change. Given the scarcity of information on this topic provided to the general public by French publishing houses, a resource facilitating metalexicographical investigations is particularly helpful. In addition to enabling a better understanding of French dictionaries, DiCo may be useful to linguists interested in lexicology and diachronic and diatopic variation. Finally, it might also prove useful for building lexicons for natural language processing. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

While lung cancer screening is crucial for improving early diagnosis and survival rates, it faces multiple challenges in China, including public awareness, limited medical resources, high costs, follow-up management, technical capabilities, coverage, and policy funding. The rapid development of generative pretrained transformer (GPT) technology presents new opportunities for lung cancer screening. It can enhance health education, optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, improve coverage, strengthen follow-up management, and advance technical capabilities. Furthermore, it can help improve policy and financial support while fostering collaboration among the government, medical institutions, and various sectors of society to overcome these obstacles. This collaboration would facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, ultimately reducing the mortality rate. However, several challenges remain in the practical application of these technologies, including the need for technological innovation, policy support, and ethical considerations. Multidisciplinary cooperation is needed to overcome these challenges. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The World Health Organization recommends using the ICD-10 system to standardize death certificate coding, a task often supported by semi-automated systems. This paper assesses the effectiveness of BERT and Mistral language models in automating this process, focusing particularly on their handling of varied instance densities per ICD code, ranging from 1 (simulating the introduction of a new code) to 100 (representing well-established codes). Through extensive comparative experiments, we find that the finetuned Mistral model substantially outperforms BERT, especially in scenarios with limited data. Mistral's higher effectiveness, even with limited data from less commonly used codes, highlight its potential to significantly enhance automated coding systems.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, for discrete outputs such as language, optimizing GANs remains an open problem with many instabilities, as no gradient can be properly back-propagated from the discriminator output to the generator parameters. An alternative is to learn the generator network via reinforcement learning, using the discriminator signal as a reward, but such a technique suffers from moving rewards and vanishing gradient problems. Finally, it often falls short compared to direct maximum-likelihood approaches. In this paper, we introduce Generative Cooperative Networks, in which the discriminator architecture is cooperatively used along with the generation policy to output samples of realistic texts for the task at hand. We give theoretical guarantees of convergence for our approach, and study various efficient decoding schemes to empirically achieve state-of-the-art results in two main NLG tasks.

In this exploratory study, we examine subscription trends on three political sub-forums on Reddit during the 2016 US presidential elections:/The_Donald,/SandersForPresident, and/HillaryClinton. As a theoretical framework, we draw from work on online communities’ group identity and cohesion. Concretely, we investigate how subscription dynamics relate to positive, negative and neutral news events occurring during the election cycle. We classify news events using a sentiment analysis of event-related news headlines. We observe that users who supported Sanders displayed no consolidation of support for Clinton after she won the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Secondly, we show that negative news events affected Sanders and Clintons subscription trends negatively, while showing no effect for Donald Trump. This gives empirical credence to Trump’s controversial claim that he could “stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any voters”. We offer a number of explanations for the observed phenomena: the nature of the content of the three subreddits, their cultural dynamics, and changing dynamics of partisanship. We posit that the ‘death of expertise’ expresses itself on Reddit as a switch in persuasion tactics from a policy-based to an emotions-based approach, and that group members’ agreement on policy proved a weak marker for online communities’ group identity and cohesion. We also claim that strong partisanship coupled with weak party affiliation among Millennials contributed to the low levels of Democratic support consolidation after Clinton won the nomination. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To tackle these issues, we propose LLM4SAC, a novel algorithm that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) framework to achieve USV autonomous docking tasks. LLM4SAC addresses these issues by leveraging the advanced contextual understanding and adaptive decision-making capabilities of LLMs. By providing high-level, context-specific guidance, LLMs enhance the RL agent's ability to interpret complex environmental data and adjust strategies in real time. This reduces the reliance on extensive simulated training datasets and increases the robustness and accuracy of the system under actual operating conditions. The dynamic request policy further refines the system's efficiency, querying LLMs only when necessary to minimize computational demands and interaction costs. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that LLM4SAC significantly improves docking success rates, reduces computational costs, and enhances adaptability to dynamic conditions.

The objective of this study is to know which classification algorithm performs better on two domains of text with different length. We have applied six machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, random forest, Naïve Bayes, and decision tree) and compared them on the basis f-score, precision, recall, and accuracy. In the IMDb dataset, logistic regression performs better among all and gives the highest accuracy of 96.3% and f-score of 80.6%. The second highest is achieved with Naïve Bayes with 95.89 and 80.05% f-score. Naïve Bayes gives the highest accuracy of 81.08% and an f-score of 42.45% in the STS-Gold dataset. The second highest is achieved with logistic regression giving an accuracy of 80.09 and 41.52% f-score. We found that logistic regression and Naïve Bayes are performing better among all the algorithms on both datasets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The difficulty of detecting, classifying, and quantifying emotions in text in any form are addressed in this study. We consider English text collected from social media sites such as Twitter and various Kaggle datasets that can provide information useful in a variety of ways, particularly opinion mining. However, analysing and categorising text based on emotions is a difficult task and might be thought of as a more advanced kind of Sentiment Analysis. This work provides a system for categorising text into three types of emotions: positive, negative, and neutral. This analysis can be utilized by authorities to better understand people's mental health and to make appropriate policy decisions to combat the coronavirus, which is hurting the world's social well-being and economy. © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The consequences of misinformation can be profound, affecting public opinion, policy decisions, and even public health. Therefore, detecting and reducing the spread of fake news is an essential issue that requires reliable and precise solutions. Historically, the field of fake news detection has witnessed notable advancements, but several shortcomings have persisted. Many earlier approaches struggled to attain the requisite levels of accuracy. Another formidable obstacle that these earlier approaches encountered was the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the tactics employed by those who spread fake news. They employ sensational language, which uses phrases with high emotional content to attract readers and elicit a strong emotional response. Recognizing these deficiencies, we present an innovative solution that leverages the state-of-the-art RoBERTa model and a meticulously modified deep neural network architecture. Our approach stands out by not only recognizing the urgency of the fake news detection problem but also by proposing architectural enhancements. It specifically targets the inadequacies of prior methods. We introduce attention mechanisms designed to identify subtle cues indicative of misinformation. The feature extraction techniques capture the nuanced patterns that fake news articles often follow. These architectural refinements make our model extremely effective and achieve an accuracy of 99.76%. The comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our RoBERTa-based model consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art fake news detection models, emphasizing the crucial role of advanced language models in combating misinformation.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The actualization of “dual carbon” targets is contingent upon the foundation of robust fiscal policies, and meticulous assessments of policy documentation are instrumental in reflecting the foreseen efficacies of these measures. The study employs text mining techniques to articulate evaluative benchmarks for fiscal policy scripts under the “dual carbon” framework and engages a bidirectional fixed-effects model to corroborate the linkage between fiscal policy implements and carbon emissions, alongside a holistic appraisal using the PMC-CRITIC index model. The research corroborates that fiscal instruments, such as tax reliefs and green fiscal transfers, significantly encourage the diminution of carbon emissions. The average PMC-CRITIC index of the policy specimens assessed is 0.62, indicating a level that is permissible yet indicating potential for further refinement. Of the reviewed policy samples, the preponderance adheres to satisfactory thresholds, with an ensuing tier demonstrating exceptional policy. The average evaluations of policy timeliness, nature, and evaluation are laudable, notwithstanding the necessity for ameliorations in the precision of policy objectives, the credibility of the policy objects, and the targeted applicability of policy tools. Accordingly, in the trajectory of impending policy development, there should be an amplification of the collaborative mechanisms both horizontally among sundry tiers of local governance and vertically across disparate bureaucratic strata, the adoption of a systemized approach to elucidate and resolve the fundamental dissonances in actualizing “dual carbon” objectives. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Authors from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, and China discuss takeovers in the context of China as a rising power in the global M&A market and re-examine takeover as an efficient method for corporate competition, consolidation, and restructuring. China has come to embrace takeovers as a market practice and is seeking directions for further reforms of its law, regulatory model, and banking system in order to compete with other economic powers. Yet, China is at a very different economic development stage and has different legal and political structures. State-owned enterprises dominate the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets - a very different landscape from UK and European exchanges. Researchers and policy makers are currently developing options in response to needs for reform. Recently, China has also announced the opening of its financial markets to foreign ownership. This book reflects on the UK and European models and focuses on the policy choices for China to transform its capital market. The book is of interest to postgraduate students and researchers (LLM, PhD, postdocs), law and management/finance academics, and policy makers. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Although the science of data mining and machine learning has done much to address the problem of these tools, their scope is still limited regarding the management of human language which has inherent uncertainty and ambiguity. This research seeks to address this gap by illustrating how to apply a machine learning tool in a way that embraces the so-called uncertainty neutrality using the orange data analysis tool for analysis of visualized data. It is also important to note in the research that the combination of neutral and intelligent analysis with using applications such as orange increases the efficiency of sentiment classification and expands the theoretical scope of sentiment data analysis. Their findings underscore that this perspective seeks to illuminate details which other methods tend to ignore and hence offer a much more nuanced understanding of human cognition. Practically, this research presents an efficient paradigm as the new framework can be employed in market intelligence, evaluation of public policy and intelligent interface design, among others. As a result, this research does not only contribute to the body of knowledge within the profession of data science but also explores new dimensions in understanding human cognition. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

However, it is necessary to conduct extensive research in order to develop advanced methodologies and practices of social media exploitation in government for the above purposes. This chapter contributes in this direction by presenting a methodology for the efficient exploitation of multiple Web 2.0 social media by government agencies in order to broaden and enhance e-participation. It is based on a central platform which enables posting content and deploying micro web applications (‘Policy Gadgets’-Padgets) to multiple popular Web 2.0 social media, and also collecting users’ interactions with them (e.g. views, comments, ratings) in an efficient manner using their application programming interfaces (API). These interaction data undergo various levels of processing, such as calculation of useful analytics, opinion mining and simulation modelling, in order to provide effective support to public decision and policy makers. A first evaluation of the proposed methodology in a series of pilot applications gave positive results as to its capabilities and value, and at the same time revealed some critical preconditions for its successful application. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Predictions of the PM2.5 concentration must be accurate for pollution reduction strategies and policy actions to succeed. This research article presents a novel approach for forecasting PM2.5 pollution in Delhi by combining a pre-trained CNN model with a transformer-based model called CATALYST (Convolutional and Transformer model for Air Quality Forecasting). This proposed strategy uses a mixture of the two models. To derive attributes of the PM2.5 timeline of data, a pre-existing CNN model is utilized to transform the data into visual representations, which are analyzed subsequently. The CATALYST model is trained to predict future PM2.5 pollution levels using a sliding window training approach on extracted features. The model is utilized for analyzing temporal dependencies in PM2.5 time-series data. This model incorporates the advancements in the transformer-based architecture initially designed for natural language processing applications. CATALYST combines positional encoding with the Transformer architecture to capture intricate patterns and variations resulting from diverse meteorological, geographical, and anthropogenic factors. In addition, an innovative approach is suggested for building input–output couples, intending to address the problem of missing or partial data in environmental time-series datasets while ensuring that all training data blocks are comprehensive. On a PM2.5 dataset, we analyze the proposed CATALYST model and compare its performance with other standard time-series forecasting approaches, such as ARIMA and LSTM. The outcomes of the experiments demonstrate that the suggested model works better than conventional methods and is a potential strategy for accurately forecasting PM2.5 pollution. The applicability of CATALYST to real-world scenarios can be tested by running more experiments on real-world datasets. This can help develop efficient pollution mitigation measures, impacting public health and environmental sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, existing retrieval-augmented approaches face challenges in addressing diverse queries and documents, particularly for medical knowledge queries, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel plug- and-play LLM-based retrieval method called Self-Rewarding Tree Search (SeRTS) based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a self-rewarding paradigm. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the effectiveness of tree search, SeRTS boosts the zero-shot performance of retrieving high-quality and informative results for RAG. We further enhance retrieval performance by fine-tuning LLMs with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) objectives using the trajectories collected by SeRTS as feedback. Controlled experiments using the BioASQ-QA dataset with GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLama2-7b demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the BM25 retriever and surpasses the strong baseline of self-reflection in both efficiency and scalability. Moreover, SeRTS generates higher-quality feedback for PPO training than self-reflection. Our proposed method effectively adapts LLMs to document retrieval tasks, enhancing their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents for RAG in the context of medical knowledge queries. This work presents a significant step forward in leveraging LLMs for accurate and comprehensive biomedical question answering. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Tweets in Germany were examined in the first three months of COVID-19 and monkeypox to examine concerns and issues raised by the public. Understanding views and positions of the public could help to shape future public health campaigns. Few qualitative studies reviewed large datasets, and the results provide the first instance of the public thinking comparing COVID-19 and monkeypox. We retrieved 15,936 tweets from Germany using query words related to both epidemics in the first three months of each one. A sequential explanatory mixed methods research joined a machine learning approach with thematic analysis using a novel rapid tweet analysis protocol. In COVID-19 tweets, there was the selfing construct or feeling part of the emerging narrative of the spread and response. In contrast, during monkeypox, the public considered othering after the fatigue of the COVID-19 response, or an impersonal feeling toward the disease. During monkeypox, coherence and reconceptualization of new and competing information produced a customer rather than a consumer/producer model. Public healthcare policy should reconsider a one-size-fits-all model during information campaigns and produce a strategic approach embedded within a customer model to educate the public about preventative measures and updates. A multidisciplinary approach could prevent and minimize mis/disinformation. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The information systems (IS) discipline offers a unique perspective to move this stream of literature forward. Using a semiautomated thematic analysis approach based on the topic modeling technique, we review a broad range of information security literature to investigate how we may integrate and advance our understanding of information security. Our analysis reveals four major themes, including information security policy (ISP) compliance, motivations and susceptibility, software security decisions, and firm security strategy. We also identify a theme of security in broader contexts, in which studies consider the societal impacts of information security and online hacker behavior. This review contributes to IS literature by 1) synthesizing the broad range of information security research published in the top journals of the field, moving beyond prior reviews focusing on a narrower scope such as individual ISP compliance; 2) identifying major themes and proposing an overarching research framework encompassing these themes and their interconnections, allowing us to envision future research directions; and 3) enumerating a semiautomated topic modeling approach that other researchers can employ.  © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The originality of this study resides in the employment of deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to execute sentiment analysis with an elevated degree of complexity. The examination encompasses three principal dimensions of sentiment: Sentiment, Tone, and Object, with the intention of offering profound insights into public perceptions regarding various social challenges. The fundamental sentiment is categorized into three classifications: Positive, Neutral, and Negative. Moreover, the Tone analysis introduces an additional layer of comprehension that encompasses Support, Suggestion, Criticism, Complaint, and Others, thereby delineating a more precise communicative context. The Object dimension is employed to ascertain the target of the sentiment, whether it pertains to an Individual, Organization, Policy, or other entity. This inquiry applied the analysis to several clusters of social issues, including Poverty and Economic Disparity, Health and Wellbeing, Education and Literacy, Violence and Security, as well as Environment and Social Life. The findings are anticipated to aid the government in devising policies that are more effective and responsive to the exigencies of society, through an enhanced understanding of public sentiment. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

The use of dark patterns is considered an infringement of users' rights and privacy. In this study, we reveal the users' responses toward dark patterns by analyzing 12 years of tweets. Our findings include 1) users in countries in which dark patterns-related regulations have been implemented have a higher level of discussions about dark patterns; 2) tweets about dark patterns shifted from around 2017 from sharing their diversity to acting to resist them; 3) the commonly discussed dark pattern types of tweets are sneaking, obstruction, and interface interference, which are widely used in e-commerce sites. Our findings may help policymakers and regulators to promote our more secure internet use.  © 2023 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Analyzing German parliamentary debates on agriculture and food with structural topic modeling\n                    ABSTRACT: This study employs structural topic modeling (STM) to quantitatively and for the first time analyze parliamentary debates on agriculture and food in the German Bundestag, focusing on the period leading up to the 2023 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Drawing on data from parliamentary speeches between January 2017 and June 2022, the research aims to understand whether and, if so, how key challenges of the agri-food sector identified by scientists are addressed by the parliamentarians. The paper thus adds empirical evidence concerning the debate on the uptake of research knowledge in politics. It does so by identifying key topics, tracking their temporal evolution, and assessing how party affiliation, constituency, gender, and age of the speakers influence discourse. The results reveal 24 distinct topics, spanning areas such as agriculture-environment interactions, rural development, animal welfare, and economic aspects of farming. Temporal analysis shows shifting priorities over time, with economic issues and sector transformation gaining prominence as CAP negotiations progress. Critically, the findings suggest that parliamentary discourse in Germany aligns with main challenges the agri-food sector faces, albeit with variations influenced by party affiliation, geographical and demographic factors. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of parliamentary engagement with agricultural issues and informs policy-making and voter decision-making processes. Its breakdown of how (frequently) certain issues were discussed reveals general trends, but also country-specific challenges, allowing for better comparative policy analysis. © 2024 The Author\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We employed machine-learning-based natural language processing techniques to analyze the user-generated content posted on Twitter of Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) student-athletes to study changes in their sentiment as it relates to the COVID-19 crisis, major societal events, and policy decisions. Our analysis found that positive sentiment slightly outweighed negative sentiment overall, but that there was a noticeable uptick in negative sentiment in May and June 2020 in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter protests. The most commonly expressed emotions by these athletes were joy, trust, anticipation, and fear, suggesting that they used social media as an outlet to share primarily optimistic sentiments, while still publicly expressing strong negative sentiments like fear and trepidation about the pandemic and other important contemporary events. Athletic administrators, ACC coaches, support staff, and other professionals can use findings like these to guide sound, evidence-based decision-making and to better track and promote the emotional wellness of student-athletes.

This information is already abundant and available via Online Social Media. The missing link is a rigorous, anonymized and open source artefact that gives feedback to stakeholders and constituents. To address this, BeWell, an unobtrusive, low latency multi-resolution measurement for the observation, analysis and modelling of community dynamics, is proposed. To assess communal well-being, 42 Facebook pages of a large public university in Germany are analyzed with a dictionary-based text analytics program, LIWC. We establish the baseline of emotive discourse across the sample, and detect significant campus-wide events in this proof of concept implementation, then discuss future iterations including a community dashboard and a participatory management plan.

We purport that members of parliament (MPs) balance a variety of incentives over the electoral cycle. While they emphasize issues that relate to the policy-making agenda of their party right after an election, competition with other parties increasingly gains influence over legislators’ priorities as the next election day approaches. We show supportive evidence for these patterns based on a unique longitudinal dataset combining information on sponsorship of legislative proposals, public opinion, party manifestos, and committee chair positions in Germany between 1990 and 2013. By bringing variation within the electoral cycle to our attention, the results enhance our understanding of the factors that set the incentive structure for MPs and the relationship between party competition and legislative behavior. © 2023 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Such a task can be accomplished by directly querying the policy statement with the regulation text. Automation of the process requires an expressive meaning-based framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper discusses the Ontological Semantics approach to the issue of verifying compliance and illustrates the potential of utilizing the framework in the domain of Privacy management for NLP-related tasks. As an example a section from BCBS and corresponding HIPAA regulations are used. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This work uses the techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and Aduna clustering to present a comprehensive review of five decades (1970-2017) of research on healthcare pricing. The study maps the stages of evolution in healthcare pricing research with the help of parameters such as research themes, prominent authors and journals, keywords, institutions and countries where these studies were conducted. Findings highlight the gaps in the extant literature, which present valuable opportunities for academia and policymakers in the field of healthcare pricing.

Government policy has a standard meaning, namely a decision systematically made by the government with specific goals and objectives relating to the public interest, whether carried out directly or indirectly. Sentiment analysis analyzes people’s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from written language. In this decade, Sentiment Analysis is has become a trendy research area. The purpose of this paper is to focus how to implement word2vec using similarity word as a feature expansion for minimize the vocabulary mismatch in Twitter Sentiment Analysis using “word embeddings”. This research contains 11.395 tweets for a dataset, where the dataset will be used in two classifications: Support Vector Machine Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network Algorithm. The output of Word2Vec will be used for feature expansion in this research, where the algorithm of expansion will check in each row in the corpus where has a similarity vector with that word and will replace the word with the similarity of this words if the value is 0. The dataset in Feature Expansion is using 142.545 articles from Indonesian media. The result of this research is ANN is better than SVM, where the ANN without feature expansion gets 68.89 % and using feature expansion gets 72.58 %. For SVM, the final accuracy without feature expansion is 63.95 %, and using feature expansion gets 68.56 %. This research proves that feature expansion can improve the final accuracy. © 2021, Ikatan Ahli Informatika Indonesia.

Textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) are glass boxes introduced for extracting and understanding mindsets' structure (in Latin forma mentis) from textual data. Combining network science, psycholinguistics and Big Data, TFMNs successfully identified relevant concepts in benchmark texts, without supervision. Once validated, TFMNs were applied to the case study of distorted mindsets about the gender gap in science. Focusing on social media, this work analysed 10,000 tweets mostly representing individuals' opinions at the beginning of posts. ``Gender'' and ``gap'' elicited a mostly positive, trustful and joyous perception, with semantic associates that: celebrated successful female scientists, related gender gap to wage differences, and hoped for a future resolution. The perception of ``woman'' highlighted jargon of sexual harassment and stereotype threat (a form of implicit cognitive bias) about women in science ``sacrificing personal skills for success''. The semantic frame of ``man'' highlighted awareness of the myth of male superiority in science. No anger was detected around ``person'', suggesting that tweets got less tense around genderless terms. No stereotypical perception of ``scientist'' was identified online, differently from real-world surveys. This analysis thus identified that Twitter discourse mostly starting conversations promoted a majorly stereotype-free, positive/trustful perception of gender disparity, aimed at closing the gap. Hence, future monitoring against discriminating language should focus on other parts of conversations like users' replies. TFMNs enable new ways for monitoring collective online mindsets, offering data-informed ground for policy making. © 2020 PeerJ Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research examines Fb data from 2016 to 2024 to investigate the role of online engagement in drought management. This study evaluates public discourse on drought-related matters through the analysis of five fundamental terms. The research employs topic modeling and sentiment analysis to assess regional awareness and utilizes machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Naive Bayes) in conjunction with Bag of Words to forecast drought progression. The research highlights the potential of Fb data in facilitating real-time drought management, offering significant hydrological insights. The study elucidates regional disparities in drought awareness through the examination of key terminology and sentiment, revealing that some regions exhibit a more rapid reaction to water scarcity, as indicated by Fb engagement. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Naive Bayes facilitates a predictive paradigm for detecting prospective drought hotspots through online discourse analysis. The study confirmed that participation in online communities successfully (p ≤ 0.04) alleviates the impact of drought and, on Facebook, significantly enhanced drought awareness across various regions of Pakistan (p ≤ 0.5), as confirmed through statistical analysis with a paired t-test and regression analysis over labeled sentiment and topic-classified data. Fb engagement may function as a proactive indicator, assisting policymakers and hydrologists in optimizing water resource allocation in drought-prone areas, thus enhancing drought mitigation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This is the first study to investigate the non prescribed GAH use behavior among transgender men in mainland China in response to the public health threat. We collected data through interviewing Chinese transgender men and mining information from their commonly-used social medial platforms with Natural Language Process (NLP) of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The motivation, means to obtain, and outcomes of their nonprescription GAH use were examined. We found that transgender men in mainland China resort to the non prescribed GAH use because they have been denied the access to prescribed GAH due to barriers produced by ant-trans stigma as the structural determinant. A conceptual framework was developed to illustrate how transgender stigma has discriminated Chinese transgender men at health policy and institutional levels and shaped Chinese transmen's nonprescription GAH use behavior. The parent-child relationship, laden with the Confucian value of filial piety, was highlighted as the cultural gatekeeper for transgender stigma to reinforce cisnormativity and prevent Chinese transgender men from obtaining prescribed GAH they need. This framework also sheds light into how these transgender men have strived to communicate with their self-created coded language to counter stigmatizing discourse on their sexual and gender identities to make life livable in a transphobic society. Our work would lay a foundation for understanding how transgender stigma is locally produced in mainland China and contributes to the denial of Chinese transgender men's access to fundamental health services as human beings, and advocate for effective intervention. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Evidence from an activity theory perspective\n                    ABSTRACT: Despite the proliferation of help options for computer-based second language (L2) listening comprehension, little attention has been given to a comprehensive understanding of the pedagogical effects. To gain a thorough understanding of the overall and moderator effects, drawing on the activity theory (AT), this study conducted a meta-analysis of 33 valid independent studies on help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension with 3697 participants involved. Results demonstrated that (a) compared with those traditional methods, help options are found to be more facilitative for L2 listening comprehension with a small-to-moderate effect of g = 0.449, 95% CI [0.303, 0.596]; and (b) the effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension are moderated by option types, feedback types, language distance types, intervention durations and learning activity types. Motivated by the results obtained, this study also discussed pedagogical implications for future studies. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The improved pedagogical effects of help options for computer-based second language (L2) listening comprehension have been well-documented. A large number of studies on the use of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension have been published. There has been no research aggregating the overall effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension. Some potential factors that may moderate the effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension remain underexplored. What this paper adds This paper aims to aggregate the overall and moderator effects from the existing publications of help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension. Compared with those traditional methods, help options are found to be more facilitative for L2 listening comprehension with a small-to-moderate effect of g = 0.449. The effects of help options for computer-based L2 listening are moderated by option types, feedback types, language distance types, intervention durations and learning activity types. Implications for practice and/or policy Help options have been confirmed to facilitate computer-based L2 listening comprehension, especially among learners of primary and secondary levels. Call for more empirical studies investigating how different types of options, feedback, language distance and intervention durations along with learning activity moderate the effectiveness. Further attempts should investigate help options for computer-based L2 listening comprehension with the integration of generative AI, large language model (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. © 2024 British Educational Research Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Consequently, users tend not to read the privacy policies, thus putting their privacy at risk. This paper describes an automated approach for assisting users to evaluate online privacy policies based on completeness. The term completeness refers to the presence of 8 sections in an online privacy policy that have been recognized as helpful in establishing the transparency of a privacy policy. Given a new online privacy policy, the proposed system employs a machine-learning based approach to predict a completeness score for the privacy policy. This score can then be used by the user to assess the risk to their privacy. © 2015 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this study, we systematically review the literature about this relationship. We obtained a sample of 204 articles published in the period from February 2020 to March 2022. Using topic modelling and qualitative analysis, we identify seven main topics on the nexus of COVID-19 and climate change: (1) impacts of COVID-19 on climate change and policy; (2) sustainable recovery after COVID-19; (3) public concern about climate change and COVID-19; (4) lessons from COVID-19 for climate change action; (5) effects of COVID-19 and climate change on the economy, food security and poverty; (6) collective responses to crises and (7) similarities and differences between COVID-19 and climate change. We discuss lessons derived from each of these topics and identify key policies and strategies for a sustainable recovery from COVID-19. Investments in low-carbon technologies and carbon taxation are the most commonly suggested policy solutions. If climate targets are to be met, climate action needs to be the focus of COVID-19 recovery.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the factors responsible for student’s behavioural intentions to use these tools are still not fully understood, especially in the context of Nigerian higher education institutions (HEIs). To support students use of Content Generative - Artificial Intelligence (CG-AI) tools for learning and research purposes, it is important that HEI administrators and policy makers understand these factors. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence Nigerian students’ behavioural intentions to use CG-AI tools for learning and research. Based on structural equation modelling technique, this study uses the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to examine the relationship between six constructs and students’ behavioural intentions to use CG-AI. Employing a paper-based survey, responses from 289 students in the Department of Computer Science were obtained from a State University in northern Nigeria. A two-step approach (Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Path Analysis) was used to analyse the relationships between both observed and latent variables. The findings showed that three of the factors, performance expectancy (α = 0.551, p < 0.001), effort expectancy (α = 0.466, p < 0.001), and social influence (α = 0.507, p < 0.001) were observed to be determinants of behavioural intentions to use CG-AI tools. Facilitating conditions, perceived risks, and attitude towards technology, on the other hand, showed no significant impact on students’ behavioural intention to use CG-AI tools. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, from the literature review, it was found that there is a scarcity of studies done on understanding the factors that affect the mode choices of women with disability. This study fills in that gap and aims to understand the experiences and challenges that affect the mode choice of women with disabilities while carrying out trips for various purposes and how they differ from their male counterparts. Through a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) methodology, questions were asked to women with disability to understand their experience and expectations from the transportation system in Bangalore, India. Sentiment analysis was carried out to understand the emotions and sentiments of two women groups while commuting in Bangalore. Working women with walking disabilities expressed that poor road infrastructure, unsafe travel experiences, lack of disabled-friendly public transport, and lack of disabled-friendly parking facilities are hurdles in commuting while women with visual impairments expressed challenges in navigation and challenges in using public transport as major barriers in travelling. The key finding of the study was that due to these challenges, women with disabilities are forced to curtail their commute or shift to non-sustainable modes of transportation, which have major implications on their education, economic condition as well as social well-being, affecting their overall Quality of Life. The study concludes with policy recommendations that can encourage and empower this section of women and provide easy access to transportation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It has been studied that digitisation, digitalisation and digital transformation (DDT) can improve efficiency, profitability and growth among SMEs. This paper studies the extent of adoption of DDT by a sample of listed SMEs in India and examines its impact on their growth. Unlike traditional methods of interviewing SMEs, this study uses a text-mining method to estimate the extent of DDT. The key words have been drawn from the literature, and the proposed methodology can help in understanding the relative positioning of the SME units in IT adoption and areas for policy intervention. We define an index of digitisation which helps us in identifying companies that are still under digitised. Further, as the period of our study is that of the COVID pandemic, the effect of digitisation has not yet been reflected in their sales growth.

The explorative study reveals the most significant factors that could predict museum visitors’ behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on the theory of planned behavior and the “cognitive-affective-conative” model to analyze TripAdvisor reviews (n = 23020) and understand the relationship between the affective and the conative components of consumer behavior. Quantitative text-mining analysis allowed us to view every lemma of every review as a single factor for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Findings: The research has enlarged the literature on museum consumer behavior. Behavioral intentions of museum visitors are affected by satisfaction dimensions, especially emotions felt; the esthetic dimension and museums’ surroundings affect consumers’ overall willingness to share positive emotions, while bad service quality and pricing policy make a visit to the museums less satisfying. Practical implications: Managers can enhance their offerings and attract new consumers by identifying the satisfaction dimensions that influence their intentions to share positive emotions. The research findings can aid museums, tour agencies and government officials in developing targeted products and strategies to meet consumers’ expectations and promote urban tourism. Originality/value: The research identified the dimensions that influence visitors’ willingness to share positive emotions through user-generated content in the context of museums. The study applies quantitative text analysis based on logit regression, which is a novel approach in the field of urban tourism research. © 2023, © International Tourism Studies Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Living Environment and Trend of Wood Utilization\n                    ABSTRACT: Improving public awareness of wood is crucial for expanding the use of wood and establishing a wood culture. In this study, the environment and trends of the public’s wood utilization were analyzed using a questionnaire survey and online text mining at a time when eco-friendly practices are gaining popularity. As a result of reducing climatic and environmental concerns and its positive physical and psychological effects, the use of wood is predicted to rise in areas intimately connected to everyday living, such as wood furniture, wooden structures, and interior materials. Nonetheless, there was a negative awareness that wood was expensive, difficult to maintain, and associated with deforestation. The correlations between wood-related search terms on major Korean portal sites were analyzed and categorized into five groups: Wooden architecture, cultural education, woodworking, wood industry, and wood policy. As a building material, wood was seen as more traditional and friendly than reinforced concrete and stone. Eighty-six percent of respondents expected to utilize wood as a building material in the future, regardless of whether the wood is domestically produced or imported. Sixty-five percent responded favorably about the effects of wood on the health of wooden home inhabitants. It is believed that both active publicity and quantifiable value analysis of human and environmental friendliness are required to increase pro-environment awareness of wood utilization. © 2022 The Korean Society of Wood Science & Technology.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this sense, greenwashingis used when a company states a false claim about its products and practices being environmentally friendly. It is an important issue and has attracted the attention of policymakers to strengthen consumer law and new companies with the mission of helping brands and consumers to become more eco-friendly. However, manual screening of websites and social networks for sustainable claims (green claims) is time-consuming. Automatic detection of green claims is an underexplored problem from a computer science perspective, and thus, we present the design, training and evaluation of different approaches in this study. Our experiments reveal that although pre-trained models present high performance, they also show sensibility to adversarial attacks, such as character-swap-based methods, which are common in social networks. In order to understand the applicability in a real-world scenario, we also evaluated its generalization performance, which showed a notable performance across different domains.  © 2021 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

But large bodies of legal documents present challenges for conventional topic modeling methods. The task of gathering, reviewing, coding, sorting, and assessing a body of tens of thousands of legal documents is a daunting proposition. Yet recent advances in computational text analytics, a subset of the field of “artificial intelligence,” are already gaining traction in legal practice settings such as e-discovery by leveraging the speed and capacity of computers to process enormous bodies of documents, and there is good reason to believe legal researchers can take advantage of these new methods as well. Differences between conventional and computational methods, however, suggest that computational text modeling has its own limitations. The two methods used in unison, therefore, could be a powerful research tool for legal scholars. To explore and critically evaluate that potential, we assembled a large corpus of presidential documents to assess how computational topic modeling compares to conventional methods and evaluate how legal scholars can best make use of the computational methods. We focused on presidential “direct actions,” such as executive orders, presidential memoranda, proclamations, and other exercises of authority the President can take alone, without congressional concurrence or agency involvement. Presidents have been issuing direct actions throughout the history of the republic, and although the actions have often been the target of criticism and controversy in the past, lately they have become a tinderbox of debate. Hence, although long ignored by political scientists and legal scholars, there has been a surge of interest in the scope, content, and impact of presidential direct actions. Legal and policy scholars modeling direct actions into substantive topic classifications thus far have not employed computational methods. To compare the results of their conventional modeling methods with the computational method, we generated computational topic models of all direct actions over time periods other scholars have studied using conventional methods, and did the same for a case study of environmental-policy direct actions. Our computational model of all direct actions closely matched one of the two comprehensive empirical models developed using conventional methods. By contrast, our environmental-case-study model differed markedly from the only empirical topic model of environmental-policy direct actions using conventional methods, revealing that the conventional methods model included trivial categories and omitted important alternative topics. Provided a sufficiently large corpus of documents is used, our findings support the assessment that computational topic modeling can reveal important insights for legal scholars in designing and validating their topic models of legal text. To be sure, computational topic modeling used alone has its limitations, some of which are evident in our models, but when used along with conventional methods, it opens doors towards reaching more confident conclusions about how to conceptualize topics in law. Drawing from these results, we offer several use cases for computational topic modeling in legal research. At the front end, researchers can use the method to generate better and more complete topic-model hypotheses. At the back end, the method can effectively be used, as we did, to validate existing topic models. And at a meta-scale, the method opens windows to test and challenge conventional legal theory. Legal scholars can do all of these without “the machines,” but there is good reason to believe we can do it better with them in the toolkit. © 2018 George Washington University.

Notably, recent advancements in multi-round on-policy self-improving methods allow LLMs to generate new examples for training subsequent models. At the same time, multi-agent LLM systems, involving automated interactions among agents, are also increasing in prominence. Thus, in both short and long terms, LLMs may actively engage in an evolutionary process. We draw parallels between the behavior of LLMs and the evolution of human culture, as the latter has been extensively studied by cognitive scientists for decades. Our approach involves leveraging Iterated Learning (IL), a Bayesian framework that elucidates how subtle biases are magnified during human cultural evolution, to explain some behaviors of LLMs. This paper outlines key characteristics of agents' behavior in the Bayesian-IL framework, including predictions that are supported by experimental verification with various LLMs. This theoretical framework could help to more effectively predict and guide the evolution of LLMs in desired directions.

Maybe More So Than You Think\n                    ABSTRACT: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO’s vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the vulnerabilities of DPO by simpler methods so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5% of the data. We further the investigate efficacy of the existing defence methods and find that these poisoning attacks can evade the existing data anomaly detection methods.

This study uses the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMA) frame analysis grounded approach and examines the 2017 Sutherland Springs, Texas, mass shooting coverage in a house of worship by three U.S. cable television networks—CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. News reports for the first seven days following the shooting were collected from the cable networks' Twitter, YouTube, and website accounts. A total of 290 news reports were analyzed and 760 aggregate units for frames were coded. The results demonstrate that ANTMA grounded approach is an effective method for frame analysis and support research about the news media's emphasis on victims, community, and individual frames in cases of mass shootings. They identify differences in the issue-based frame of gun vs. mental health debates. Additional new frames of empathy, interventions, reactions, and security were discovered. Results also show differences in frames used and their frequency between the digital platforms of Twitter, YouTube, and websites and cable organizations. These differences show each media network's ideological perspectives or competing news narratives. The findings raise relevant questions to news coverage, policy debates about mental health and gun violence, and cultural awareness of the problem of mass shootings and public safety as the world becomes more global.

From a public policy perspective, identifying stakeholders, issues and trends is a daunting challenge, only partially addressed by traditional observation systems. Nowadays, social media is one of the biggest channels of public expression and is often used to communicate opinions and content related to City Logistics. The idea of this research is that analyzing social media content could help in understanding the public perception of City Logistics. This paper offers a methodology for collecting content from Twitter and implementing machine learning techniques (Unsupervised Learning and Natural Language Processing), to perform content and sentiment analysis. The proposed methodology is applied to more than 110 000 tweets containing City Logistics key-terms. Results allowed the building of an Interest Map of concepts and a Sentiment Analysis to determine if City Logistics entries are positive, negative or neutral. © 2020 The Authors.

It has been applied in games, recommendation systems and natural language processing. However, it is still a challenge to ensure the safety of reinforcement learning algorithms when applied to robotics in the real world. In recent years, the safe reinforcement learning methods for robotics systems have become a hot research direction, gaining extensive attention in robotics and reinforcement learning communities. This paper surveys important achievements and development tendency of safe reinforcement learning based on the existing work and focuses on their applicability in robotics. This paper first introduces the general problem description of safe reinforcement learning. Then we focus on the latest significant progress in this field from the perspective of method and performance, including constraint policy optimization, control barrier function, safety filter and adversarial training methods, and their applications in autonomous driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and other robotic systems. Finally, the future research direction of this field is prospected and discussed. © 2023 South China University of Technology.

This paper focuses on the context of a car-dependent island in the Mediterranean – Malta, where the introduction of active travel interventions is an essential but persistently difficult undertaking. The study aims to test a fully virtual method to better understand the perceptions of the islands' population of such interventions. The study deploys a Virtual Urban Living Lab (VULL), a purposely designed online participatory platform with interactive activities in which participants can give feedback on proposed intervention ideas and propose their own. The feedback was collected from 113 users over the span of a week in December 2023. Using sentiment analysis conducted through a large language model (ChatGPT 4), the findings from the VULL shed light on how the Maltese population perceives stakeholder-proposed ideas to re-design urban streets. A discussion on the main challenges and points of contention, and the positive features of the proposed intervention follows. The paper concludes with an overview of the policy-relevant feedback and the potential for urban planners and policymakers to use VULL and language models as tools for understanding public sentiment. © 2025 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The research is mainly based on the method of comparing text documents in natural language processing. The primary parameter for the analysis of the text corpus is the wording of the Strategy. The news features on the websites are checked for their consistency with the trends of the state nationality policy indicated in the document as the most voluminous section of the Strategy. The array of textual data is represented by 397 news items published on the websites in 2019. The comparison of textual data shows that the largest number of matches is found on the news feed of the website of the Council for Interethnic Relations. The focus area with the greater number of matches across all websites is establishing the environment to preserve and enrich the Russian language and the languages of the peoples of the Russian Federation. © 2020 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study collects the livestock manure treatment policy texts and livestock feeding data of 70 local governments, and uses data mining and related analysis methods to analyze the relationships between actions, actors and the effect of livestock breeding pollution control in local government policies. The results show that: The better the transmission of actions and the greater the number of actors involved in transmission of actions, the better effect of livestock breeding pollution control. It is necessary to strengthen collaboration with Department of Natural Resources in building a cycle of planting and breeding development mechanism as well as acceleration of the transformation and upgrading of animal husbandry. Meanwhile, the collaboration with Department of Science and Technology should be enhanced in strengthening fiscal and taxation policy support, and coordinating the solution of land and electricity use problems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

There is a growing number of university students using AI like ChatGPT and Bard to support their academic experience. Much of the AI in higher education research to date has focused on academic integrity and matters of authorship; yet, there may be unintended consequences beyond these concerns for students. That is, there may be people who reduce their formal social interactions while using these tools. This study evaluates 387 university students and their relationship to–and with–artificial intelligence large-language model-based tools. Using structural equation modelling, the study finds evidence that while AI chatbots designed for information provision may be associated with student performance, when social support, psychological wellbeing, loneliness, and sense of belonging are considered it has a net negative effect on achievement. This study tests an AI-specific form of social support, and the cost it may pose to student success, wellbeing, and retention. Indeed, while AI chatbot usage may be associated with poorer social outcomes, human-substitution activity that may be occurring when a student chooses to seek support from an AI rather than a human (e.g. a librarian, professor, or student advisor) may pose interesting learning and teaching policy implications. We explore the implications of this from the lens of student success and belonging. © 2024 The Author(s).

While popular narrative extraction methods such as Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts. We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in content or a narrative shift took place. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An effective recognition method significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) technology have spurred the development of statement recognition techniques. However, many methods rely on extensive datasets, and numerous sectors struggle to keep pace with intelligent advancements due to data scarcity. Policy-related questions, which often involve a plethora of technical terms, exemplify this challenge. For colloquial questions with intricate structures, models require enhanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models must prioritize key information and filter out irrelevant data, particularly when data availability is limited. To address these issues, this study utilized medical insurance approval items and related questions as data sources. It employed sentence vectors and question structures as analytical frameworks and explored innovative solutions. Specifically, the twin network fine-tuning pretraining model RoBERTa was applied to classify medical insurance items, integrating syntactic structure and question word features to pinpoint question targets. This method outperformed standard text classification models in the medical insurance domain and has potential applicability in other policy-oriented Q&A systems, thereby offering precise services to the public. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the entire pocess of building ontologies from texts cannot be fully automated and it is important to guide the knowledge engineer during the building process. This paper presents an enriched version of TERMINAE, which is a text-based methodology for ontology design. It combines a fact-based approach of modeling with the more traditional concept-centric one. We show that named entities can be used to enrich an existing ontology and to bootstrap the acquisition process. In other words, named entities are used for the conceptualisation of ontologies and not only for their population. This approach is illustrated on two use-cases based on policy documents and evaluated by measuring the Precision and Recall of the resulting ontologies with respect to pre-existing ontologies independently built by domain experts.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A bibliometric analysis of policies in China\n                    ABSTRACT: Answering how and why policies emerge and interact with one another will advance our understanding of the evolution of policies. The paper investigates policy emergence as a practice defining possible policy objects in a specific domain and policy interaction as a practice enabling the defined objects. To trace the policy evolution, we define three types of citations to describe policymaking processes, establish the citation and co-citation networks of policy documents, and then conduct a natural language processing-based bibliometric analysis. We reveal the patterns of policymaking practices and identify the focal policies in a given domain. The results within the context of Chinese innovation and entrepreneurial policies suggest the information contained in focal policies drives the direction of future policy themes, as well as regular policies, tend to cite focal policies and follow the ideas of focal policies to achieve their goals. Our findings also provide some implications for Chinese future policymaking.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to enhance understanding of loneliness dynamics through building towards a global loneliness map using social intelligence analysis. Settings and design This paper presents a proof of concept for the global loneliness map, using data collected in October 2022. Twitter posts containing keywords such as € lonely', € loneliness', € alone', € solitude' and € isolation' were gathered, resulting in 841 796 tweets from the USA. City-specific data were extracted from these tweets to construct a loneliness map for the country. Sentiment analysis using the valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning tool was employed to differentiate metaphorical expressions from meaningful correlations between loneliness and socioeconomic and emotional factors. Measures and results The sentiment analysis encompassed the USA dataset and city-wise subsets, identifying negative sentiment tweets. Psychosocial linguistic features of these negative tweets were analysed to reveal significant connections between loneliness, socioeconomic aspects and emotional themes. Word clouds depicted topic variations between positively and negatively toned tweets. A frequency list of correlated topics within broader socioeconomic and emotional categories was generated from negative sentiment tweets. Additionally, a comprehensive table displayed top correlated topics for each city. Conclusions Leveraging social media data provide insights into the multifaceted nature of loneliness. Given its subjectivity, loneliness experiences exhibit variability. This study serves as a proof of concept for an extensive global loneliness map, holding implications for global public health strategies and policy development. Understanding loneliness dynamics on a larger scale can facilitate targeted interventions and support. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

First, we discuss public-made collections of linguistic data generally: the quality and reliability of contributors and collections, and the high dependence of number of contributions on motivation and contribution policy. Second, we describe creation of games for acquiring NLP data in detail. As example, two existing games are presented. Finally, evaluation techniques for both projects are discussed. © Tribun EU 2010.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The research employs a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to identify and mine themes from comment texts, extracting multiple core discussion topics. The results show that although negative sentiments slightly outweighed positive sentiments in public comments, there was no significant difference in the focal points of attention between positive and negative sentiments. Negative sentiments primarily centered on policy specifics and implementation methods, with key concerns including details of policy execution and operational challenges. Cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, and Hangzhou exhibited higher volumes of policy-related discussions, indicating greater public engagement in these regions. Analysis of IP address distribution revealed pronounced regional concentration, particularly among residents in developed eastern coastal areas. Finally, the study proposes strategic recommendations for optimizing information dissemination on social media to enhance public willingness to participate in waste sorting initiatives.

Here, we test the hypothesis that biodiversity science has become more interdisciplinary over time. To do so, we analyze 97,945 peer-reviewed articles over a twenty-two-year time period (1990–2012) with a continuous time dynamic model, which classifies articles into concepts (i.e., topics and ideas) based on word co-occurrences. Using the model output, we then quantify different aspects of interdisciplinarity: concept diversity, that is, the diversity of topics and ideas across subdisciplines in biodiversity science, subdiscipline diversity, that is, the diversity of subdisciplines across concepts, and network structure, which captures interactions between concepts and subdisciplines. We found that, on average, concept and subdiscipline diversity in biodiversity science were either stable or declining, patterns which were driven by the persistence of rare concepts and subdisciplines and a decline in the diversity of common concepts and subdisciplines, respectively. Moreover, our results provide evidence that conceptual homogenization, that is, decreases in temporal β concept diversity, underlies the observed trends in interdisciplinarity. Together, our results reveal that biodiversity science is undergoing a dynamic phase as a scientific discipline that is consolidating around a core set of concepts. Our results suggest that progress toward addressing the biodiversity crisis via greater interdisciplinarity during the study period may have been slowed by extrinsic factors, such as the failure to invest in research spanning across concepts and disciplines. However, recent initiatives such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) may attract broader support for biodiversity-related issues and hence interdisciplinary approaches to address scientific, political, and societal challenges in the coming years. © 2019 The Authors.

The discussion on anthropogenic climate change in general, and social media specifically, has multiple different narratives. Understanding the discourses can assist efforts of mitigation, adaptation, and policy measures development. In this work, we collected 333,635 tweets in English about anthropogenic climate change. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning methods to embed the semantic meaning of the tweets into vectors, cluster the tweets, and analyze the results. We clustered the tweets into four clusters that correspond to four narratives in the discussion. Analyzing the behavioral dynamics of each cluster revealed that the clusters focus on the discussion of whether climate change is caused by humans or not, scientific arguments, policy, and conspiracy. The research results can serve as input for media policy and awareness-raising measures on climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, and facilitating future communications related to climate change. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A preceding study’s results found that there is public concern with regard to the safety of high-tech foods, such as genetically modified foods and genome-edited foods. Twitter, one of the most popular social networks, allows users to post their opinions instantaneously, making it an extremely useful tool to collect what people are actually saying online in a timely manner. Therefore, it was used for collecting data on the users’ concerns with and expectations of high-tech foods. This study collected and analyzed Twitter data on genome-edited foods and their labeling from May 25 to October 15 in 2019. Of 14,066 unique user IDs, 94.9% posted 5 or less tweets, whereas 64.8% tweeted only once, indicating that the majority of users who tweeted on this issue are not as intense, as they posted tweets consistently. After a process of refining, there were 28,722 tweets, of which 2,536 tweets (8.8%) were original, 326 (1.1%) were replies, and 25,860 (90%) were retweets. The numbers of tweets increased in response to government announcements and news content in the media. A total of six prominent peaks were detected during the investigation period, proving that Twitter could serve as a tool for monitoring degree of users’ interests in real time. The co-occurrence network of original and reply tweets provided different words from various tweets that appeared with a certain frequency. However, the network derived from all tweets seemed to concentrate on words from specific tweets with negative overtones. As a result of sentiment analysis, 54.5% to 62.8% tweets were negative about genome-edited food and the labeling policy of the Consumer Affairs Agency, respectively, indicating a strong demand for mandatory labeling. These findings are expected to contribute to the communication strategy of genome-edited foods toward social implementation by government officers and science communicators. © Copyright © 2020 Tabei, Shimura, Kwon, Itaka and Fukino.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Attackers create more complicated attack patterns and configure attack behavior to resemble normal behavior to evade detection by defenders. Thus, it is indispensable to configure a security system that accurately detects attacks on each user's system. Since the attack does not occur only at a specific point in the network, there is a limitation in identifying computer intrusion simply using network packets. A Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) is a highly effective tool for monitoring computer systems and detecting unusual or unauthorized activities. HIDS can quickly identify potential security threats by closely monitoring and analyzing system logs, configurations, file integrity, and events specific to a host machine. It helps maintain the security and integrity of individual systems by detecting unauthorized activities or policy violations. With its advanced capabilities and reliable performance, HIDS is essential to any comprehensive host-based security strategy. Although HIDS can detect insider intrusions, the known HIDS detection methods are limited to specific attacks and may be ineffective against new attack patterns. Recently, researchers applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) in HIDS to scrutinize complex attack patterns, but they could have more effectively provided useful outputs for detecting intrusions based on these patterns. In this paper, we use reinforcement learning methodology, Actor-Critic, and NLP to extract keywords that occur on each anomaly system call log and propose a rule generation framework to prevent future intrusion detection using the extracted words. We analyze the anomaly log using NLP and extract the characteristics of each attack log as the 'keyword.' Based on the unique keywords of each attack log, we utilize reinforcement learning to establish a set of rules to protect against attacks. We extracted keywords based on textrank from the system call log sequence and simultaneously provided ground truth data using the extracted keywords. Based on the extracted keywords, the pre-trained Seq2Seq model generate rules according to the reward calculation method in reinforcement learning. When calculating the reward in reinforcement learning, we used the comparison value with the pre-trained Seq2Seq model, the malware log sequence detected by the rule set based on reinforcement learning, and the false positive value generated by the normal data to create its own rule set. We verified the proposed framework using the system call log datasets: ADFA-LD, LID-DS 2021 dataset. The proposed framework demonstrated a high accuracy rate of 96.5% average when faced with different attacks. We compared the accuracy based on the proposed framework detection, textrank, and Seq2Seq model-based keyword extraction methods. As a result, the proposed framework showed relatively high accuracy against various attack logs. © 2025 The Authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We conducted semi-structured interviews with an international sample of educational professionals including researchers, teachers and designers, and reviewed interdisciplinary literature on personalisation to propose a framework for personalisation research and design. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed that professionals value each type of personalisation opportunity (eg, customising for age-appropriate content, supports for student choice, automated guidance based on learner responses) and identify challenges (eg, trade-offs between adaptive and standardised instruction). Three research/design dilemmas emerged: individualisation and equity; group customisation and individual benefit; and adaptation and validity of measurement. We discuss these dilemmas in relation to three categories of personalisation: customisation by designers or teachers to support a specific audience (grade level, course, community); individualisation to support user choice (of book to read, project topic); and adaptation of instructional activities based on automated analysis of logged user performance (performance metrics, natural language processing, cumulative indicators). We suggest some guiding questions for a generative agenda for future research on personalised instruction. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Personalised learning is popular among educational professionals. Personalised design has multiple and inconsistent definitions. A shared framework for personalised instruction would facilitate research and design. What this paper adds A succinct but comprehensive definition of personalised education. Perspectives on personalisation from an international group of practitioners and designers. A framework including three dilemmas to guide future research on the design and practice of personalised instruction. Implications for practice and/or policy A shared definition of personalisation can support communication across diverse stakeholders. The framework can guide future design and instruction with personalised educational technology. The framework identifies dilemmas that illustrate ethical pathways for policy-makers responsible for personalised education. © 2021 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 464,590 posts from January 2018 to April 2021 on the 82cook website were collected. The data were analyzed by text mining techniques, including term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), and network analyses, to identify the most prominent con-cerns faced by young people in South Korea. Findings: The study results showed that the most frequently discussed issues among mothers of adolescent children were 'educational environment,' 'physical health,' 'mental health,' 'studying abroad,' and 'child abuse.' As parents and children spend more time together during and early post-COVID-19 periods, 'child abuse' has emerged as a major issue. The distribution results by topic in the prior-and post-COVID-19 periods showed that education (44% and 41%, respectively) and health and well-being (25% and 28%, respectively) ranked the two most-frequently discussed issues among mothers. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is that the subjectivity of the researcher may have biased the setting of the topic names about the youth, and the classification results themselves cannot be considered perfect, as the algorithm automatically classified them. Originality/value: This paper provides academic originality and value by leveraging text mining to analyze the issues related to young people, thereby offering implications for policymakers, surpassing the informational value of traditional methods such as surveys or expert panels. © The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The advantages of using unsupervised learning for this task are numerous. The primary advantages include the ability to analyze any new corpus with a fraction of the effort required by supervised learning, the ability to study changes in topics of interest along time, and the ability to identify finer-grained topics of interest in these privacy policies. Based on general principles of document analysis we synthesize a cohesive framework for privacy policy topic modeling and apply it over a corpus of 4,982 privacy policies of mobile applications crawled from the Google Play Store. The results demonstrate that even with this relatively moderate-size corpus quite comprehensive insights can be attained regarding the focus and scope of current privacy policy documents. The topics extracted, their structure and the applicability of the unsupervised approach for that matter are validated through an extensive comparison to similar findings reported in prior work that uses supervised learning (which heavily depends on manual annotation of experts). The comparison suggests a substantial overlap between the topics found and those reported in prior work, and also unveils some new topics of interest. � 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, political campaigns strategically designed candidacy announcements on Twitter to produce a significant increase in online social media attention. We use large-scale online social media communications to study the factors of party, personality, and policy in the Twitter discourse following six major presidential campaign announcements for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We observe that all campaign announcements result in an instant bump in attention, with up to several orders of magnitude increase in tweets. However, we find that Twitter discourse as a result of this bump in attention has overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The bruising criticism, driven by crosstalk from Twitter users of opposite party affiliations, is organized by hashtags such as #NoMoreBushes and #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. We analyze how people take to Twitter to criticize specific personality traits and policy positions of presidential candidates. © 2017 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Understanding attitudes towards ChatGPT could help manage expectations and concerns for ChatGPT in academia, predict behaviour and inform policy. This study aimed to develop an understanding of university academics’ attitudes towards ChatGPT. A total of 11 university academics participated in semi-structured interviews. Data analysis found three main themes: (a) ethics, (b) changes to academic processes and (c) accessibility and inclusivity. Results showed academics had positive attitudes towards ChatGPT overall; however, they held negative attitudes towards the unethical use of the technology. Key findings included discrepancies in perceptions of academics’ personal ethical use of ChatGPT compared to unethical use by others. Furthermore, academics viewed ChatGPT as a useful tool for saving time and enhancing research processes and student learning. Finally, ChatGPT could increase equity among diverse groups, though it should be used with caution. Future studies could conduct a longitudinal study and recruit a larger and wider sample exploring specific and/or multidisciplinary domains for research diversity and the generalisability of findings. Implications for practice or policy: • Academic policy and codes of conduct concerning the use of ChatGPT in research and education can be refined to address key ethical concerns, such as plagiarism. • Academic educators and researchers can save time and improve processes using ChatGPT to attain better work-life balance and thus potentially improve the quality of their work.

However, gaps exist in reporting information such as victim injuries, mental health status and abuse types. The police record details of domestic violence events as structured information (e.g., gender, postcode, ethnicity), but also in text narratives describing other details such as injuries, substance use, and mental health status. However, the voluminous nature of the narratives has prevented their use for surveillance purposes. We used a validated text mining methodology on 492,393 police-attended domestic violence event narratives from 2005 to 2016 to extract mental health mentions on persons of interest (POIs) (individuals suspected/charged with a domestic violence offense) and victims, abuse types, and victim injuries. A significant increase was observed in events that recorded an injury type (28.3% in 2005 to 35.6% in 2016). The pattern of injury and abuse types differed between male and female victims with male victims more likely to be punched and to experience cuts and bleeding and female victims more likely to be grabbed and pushed and have bruises. The four most common mental illnesses (alcohol abuse, bipolar disorder, depression schizophrenia) were the same in male and female POIs. An increase from 5.0% in 2005 to 24.3% in 2016 was observed in the proportion of events with a reported mental illness with an increase between 2005 and 2016 in depression among female victims. These findings demonstrate that extracting information from police narratives can provide novel insights into domestic violence patterns including confounding factors (e.g., mental illness) and thus enable policy responses to address this significant public health problem.

RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al. (2022b), offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards “self-improvement” by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.

Modern S&T electronic abstract databases such as Science Citation Index and INSPEC provide comprehensive information on research activities in many different domains. These databases mostly include English language publications. However for a country such as Thailand which does not use English as the primary language, some S&T information is represented in Thai language as well. Hence to reflect the whole R&D activities in the country, there is a need to extract intelligence from both English and Thai language research publications. In this paper, we describe our ongoing project to consolidate research content focusing on Thai language. We present a framework called Thailand's Research Information Portal and Search Engine (ThaiReSearch) which integrates research information from various databases such as researchers, research projects, patent records, and publications. The framework also provides an intelligent information analysis module which incorporates the following functions: statistical analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and text mining. By using this system, Thai R&D managers and policy planners could improve their strategic decision-making processes towards a sustainable economy. © 2008 PICMET.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to explore the emotional attitudes of Chinese netizens toward the COVID-19 opening-up policies and their related thematic characteristics. Using Python, 145,851 texts were collected from the Weibo platform. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques were employed to reveal the distribution of public emotions and key themes. The study found that the proportions of emotions were as follows: Good (46%), Happy (11%), Anger (17%), Disgust (6%), Sadness (10%), Surprise (2%), and Fear (8%). Through topic analysis, the following main themes were identified: medical resource shortages, healthcare workers, national policies, and COVID-19 sequelae. Based on the results of sentiment and topic analysis, public emotions toward the COVID-19 opening-up policies were categorized into three dimensions: panic, trust, and acceptance. Panic was primarily associated with medical resource shortages, concerns about COVID-19 sequelae, and doubts about policy transparency and fairness. Trust was reflected in public gratitude toward healthcare workers and support for national policies. Acceptance represented the public’s optimism about returning to normal life. The findings demonstrate that changes in public emotions not only reflect the social impact of policy implementation but also highlight the critical roles of medical resource allocation, information transparency, and psychological health support in adjusting pandemic policies. This study provides empirical evidence and theoretical support for the government to develop more precise pandemic control strategies.

The annotated manifestos are produced by the Comparative Manifesto Project, while the parliamentary speeches annotated with policy areas (subjects) have been recently released under CLARIN-DK. In the paper, we investigate how often the seven parties addressed immigration in the manifestos and parliamentary debates, and we analyse both datasets after having applied NLP tools to them. A sentiment analysis tool was run on the manifestos and its results were compared with the manifestos’ annotations, while topic modeling was applied to the parliamentary speeches in order to outline central themes in the immigration debates. Many of the resulting topic groups are related to cultural, religious and integration aspects which were heavily debated by politicians and media when discussing immigration policy during the past decade. Our analyses also show differences and similarities between parties and indicate how the 2015 immigrant crisis is reflected in the two types of data. Finally, we discuss advantages and limitations of our quantitative and tool-based analyses. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This assessment typically covers various aspects (including economic, social, and environmental impacts) and is designed to ensure that policy proposals are well-founded, transparent, and that potential impacts are thoroughly examined before decisions are made. This process is nowadays performed by human experts and requires a significant amount of time. It is also characterized by some subjectivity that makes it difficult for citizens and companies to perceive the process as a transparent one. Moreover, public administration services responsible for LIA recognize significant difficulties in performing a timely and effective impact assessment exercise due to the lack of human and financial resources. To answer this call, this paper presents an artificial intelligence-based system to automatizing part of the impact assessment process, with the specific objective of detecting administrative burdens from transposed EU legislation. The system is built on a fine-tuned, transformer-based architecture leveraging transfer learning, making it an innovative tool for automating legislative impact assessment. Comprehensive testing on transposed European legislation demonstrated that the system significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy in what has traditionally been a complex and time-consuming task. © 2025 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The approach is based on science mapping models recently developed in infoscience, being a generalization of the so-called Science Overlay Mapping methodology, referred to as Topic Overlay Mapping (TOM). It is shown that via applications of TOM in visualization, document clustering, time series analysis etc. the in-depth exploration and even the measurement of cognitive complexity and its dynamics is feasible for scientific domains. The methodology allows for an ICT-based understanding of contexts induced by large-scale scientific text collections that deeply enhance and drive further, detailed exploration of their contents (augmented cognition). As a use case, an empirical study is presented, focusing on the discovery of a policy-relevant discourse within SSH based on the proposed toolbox of TOM. © 2014 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study presents an in-depth empirical investigation of this law in 651 Chinese provincial government work reports (2003–2023). Employing natural language processing techniques (including Jieba word segmentation with a custom dictionary) and a double-logarithmic regression model, we analyzed word frequency distributions. Our findings indicate that the Zipf coefficient in these reports is close to 1, confirming general adherence to Zipf’s law. Over the 21-year period, the Zipf coefficient exhibits fluctuations, with a notable inflection point in 2011, after which it follows a consistent upward trend. This shift is likely influenced by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which marked a transition toward more standardized and centralized policy communication. While regional differences among eastern, central, western, and northeastern provinces are minimal, centrally governed municipalities exhibit higher Zipf coefficients than other provincial-level regions. Although our findings largely confirm the applicability of Zipf’s Law to this specific corpus, this study is limited by the exclusion of prefecture- and county-level reports. Future research can address this limitation by incorporating a broader range of administrative levels and by conducting cross-country and cultural comparisons of political documents. Further investigation of alternate quantitative linguistic laws (e.g., Heaps’ Law, Menzerath’s Law) within this corpus is also warranted. © 2025 Yanfang LI.

Various methods are proposed to explore networks generation and evolution mechanism. However, the previous methods usually pay more attention to macroscopic characteristics rather than microscopic characteristics, which may lead to lose much information of individual patterns. Since communication network is associated closely with user behaviours, the model of communication network also takes into consideration the individual patterns. By implicitly labeling each network node with a latent attribute-activity level, we introduce an efficent approach for the simulation and modeling of communication network based on topic model. We illustrate our model on a real-world email network obtained from email logs. Experimental results show that the synthetic network preserves some of the global characteristics and individual behaviour patterns. Besides, due to privacy policy and restricted permissions, it is arduous to collect a real large-scale communication network dataset in a short time. Much research work is constrained by the absence of real large-scale datasets. To address this problem, we can use this model to generate a large-scale synthetic communication network by a small amount of captured communication stream. Moreover, it has linear runtime complexity and can be paralleled easily. © 2016, Science Press.

Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving. There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences. Our aim is that this report will serve as a focal point for both researchers and practitioners who are exploring, adapting, using, and evaluating GenAI and LLM-based tools in computing classrooms. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In disaster management, social media data can be mined to discover public perceptions and concerns on large disaster events. However, converting large data streams into useful information remains a challenge due to the unstructured nature of textual data. ?is study proposes an interactive topic modeling method to analyze microblog data for understanding the dynamics of public expressions immediately a?er a major explosion event. First, we extract topics from microblog message data. In order to test the influence of the number of topics, the topics are detected at multiple levels of granularity by varying the number of topics. Second, these topics are used to detect topical compositions of contents at different time slices and assess the topic evolution over time. The topic evolution patterns are visualized by the streamgraph method to discover informative topics to help to take further actions. Third, since the first-level topics are not informative, we conduct a second-level topic (subtopic) analysis to detect key decision elements by choosing investigation from the first-level topics, a hot focus in any man-made disaster. The results improve our understanding of the topic composition evolution around major man-made disasters and have implications on officials deciding what and when to release formal investigation information to the public. © 2018 is held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Online platforms are faced with the task of moderating abusive content to mitigate societal harm and foster inclusivity. Despite numerous methods developed for automated detection of abusive language, the problem continues to persist. This ongoing challenge necessitates further research and development to enhance the effectiveness of abusive content detection systems and implement proactive measures to create safer and more respectful online space. To address the automatic detection of abusive languages in social media platforms, this paper describes the models submitted by our team - MUCS, to the shared task”Abusive Comment Detection in Tamil and Telugu” at DravidianLangTech - in Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP) 2023. This shared task addresses the abusive comment detection in code-mixed Tamil and Telugu texts, that includes the comments in both native script and romanized script, and romanized Tamil (RTamil) text. Two distinct models: i) AbusiveML - a model implemented utilizing Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) algorithm fed with Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of n-grams of words and character sequences within word boundary (char wb) both in the range (1, 3) and ii) AbusiveTL - a Transfer Learning (TL) approach with three different Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models, for three datasets along with random oversampling to deal with data imbalance, are submitted to the shared task for detecting abusive language in the given code-mixed texts. The AbusiveTL model fared well among these two models, with macro F1 scores of 0.46, 0.74, and 0.49 securing 1st, 1st, and 4th rank for code-mixed Tamil, Telugu, and RTamil texts respectively. © DravidianLangTech 2023 - 3rd Workshop on Speech and Language Technologies for Dravidian Languages, associated with 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2023 - Proceedings.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To understand what does drive public interest in invasive plants in the US, we investigated Google Trends search data from 2010 to 2020 for 209 introduced plant species found in the continental US. Using a phylogenetically-controlled structural equation model, we investigated three hypothesized drivers of interest: (1) plant abundance as quantified by national and state-level occurrence records in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, (2) four key plant traits that might influence plant conspicuousness to the general public: ornamental use, human health risks, monoculture formation, and plants with positive economic value, and (3) media coverage, in particular the volume and sentiment of news articles over the same 10-year period. Public search interest was highest for the most abundant introduced species and those with human health risks, but significantly lower for ornamentals. News coverage was mostly negatively toned and disproportionately focused on a relatively small group of widespread invasive species, with significantly lower and more positively-worded coverage of ornamentals. Ultimately, we suggest that a narrow emphasis on a few highly covered ‘notorious’ invasive plant species, with lower and more positive coverage of ornamental introduced species, could send mixed messages and weaken public awareness of the threats of biological invasions. However, the generally strong linkages between public search interest and media coverage of invasive plants suggests ample opportunity to improve messaging and increase public awareness. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It shapes well-rounded personalities, fosters innovation, and cultivates responsible citizens, contributing to social stability and national development. Our research aims to establish an evaluation system for college student mental health education policies based on the Policy Modeling Consistency Index (PMC-Index) model and text mining techniques, quantitatively assessing 15 representative policies. Method: This paper first retrieves policy documents through specialized policy databases and government websites, excluding policies that have already expired or become invalid. The sample selections of this research range from 2001 to 2024, including national guidelines and specific actions. Referring to the above steps of policy effectiveness evaluation, our research comprehensively analyses the implementation effectiveness of the foregoing policies regarding mental health curricula, service systems, crisis intervention, and family cooperation. In the following, based on 10 major variables, 38 sub-variables are constructed with a binary coding system to quantify the content of policy for objectivity. Then, the ROSTCM 6.0 software is used for text segmentation and word frequency statistics, meanwhile, keywords and semantic networks of core policies will be considered for analysis. Subsequently, the PMC-Index is computed based on the multi-input–output matrix and a diagram of the PMC-Surface is drawn with the help of MATLAB to express policy consistency and deficiencies in different dimensions intuitively. Results: Among the 15 policies, 11 exhibit Great Consistency (GC), and 4 fall under Acceptable Consistency (AC). Higher scores are found in Policy Function (X6), Policy Evaluation (X8), and Policy Goals (X9), indicating practical implementation and clear guidance. However, lower scores in Policy Nature (X1), Policy Timeliness (X2), Policy Issuing Agency (X3), and Policy Object (X4) reveal deficiencies in policy innovation, long-term planning, and target group coverage. Particularly, short-term policies lack sustainability, limiting their long-term effectiveness in supporting students’ mental health. Through PMC-Surface analysis, it is found that lower scores in timeliness and adaptability to target groups are primary factors contributing to surface depressions in the diagram, suggesting that these policies struggle to meet the diverse needs of different types of higher education institutions. The research also highlights significant areas for improvement in resource allocation, support system construction, and personalized mental health services. Some policies fail to address regional disparities, with weaker implementation in underdeveloped areas and insufficient safeguard mechanisms. Discussion: In the future, long-term planning for policy optimization is expected, in which priority would be given to localized resource allocation and close collaboration among schools, families, and society to ensure the comprehensiveness and sustainability of mental health education services. The research has identified certain strengths and weaknesses in the policies concerning mental health education for college students in China, thus providing theoretical references and specific recommendations that can be effectively implemented in higher education institutions.

Conflicts within the commission and legislative amendments in trilogues\n                    ABSTRACT: This article aims to examine the effect of intra‐institutional conflicts in the European Commission on the extent of changes made to legislative proposals in trilogue negotiations. We develop and test three hypotheses related to how conflicts within the Commission, namely that intra‐institutional disagreements during policy formulation (h1), and potential conflicts with previous (h2) or subsequent (h3) colleges of commissioners, increase the number of amendments to the Commission’s proposal adopted in trilogues. To test our hypotheses, we use a new dataset measuring the number of changes between Commission proposals and adopted legislation for 216 legislative acts negotiated between 2012 and 2019 by means of text‐mining techniques. It is important to note that we control for differences between the Commission’s proposals and the co‐legislators’ positions in order to distinguish between an effect on preferences anticipation and on the negotiations proper. Our results indicate that intra‐institutional conflicts affect the Commission’s anticipation of the co‐legislators’ positions. The effect on its behaviour in trilogues, that is, after the legislative proposal has been tabled, is less clear. Regarding the latter, only the number of Directorates‐General involved is significantly linked with the number of amendments tabled. These findings suggest that while intra‐institutional disagreements affect the Commission’s role in trilogues, the range of preferences is more important than the intensity of conflicts. © 2021 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study evaluated the magnitude and pattern of AV parking-related crashes that occurred between January 2017 and August 2022 in California. The study applied descriptive analysis, unsupervised text mining, and supervised text mining (Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logitboost, Random Forest, and Neural network) with resampling techniques. It was indicated that parking-related crashes constitute about 16% of all AV crashes, most of them are likely to impact the AV on the rear or left side. The unsupervised text mining results showed that AVs in the conventional mode of operation, reversing, and parallel parking are among the key themes associated with parking-related crashes. The Support Vector Machine, Logitboost, Random Forest, and Neural network showed relatively high prediction accuracy. The important features from these supervised text mining approaches were conventional mode, reservsing, passenger vehicle, parallel parking, which confirm the preliminary findings in the unsupervised text mining. The implications of the findings to operators and policymakers are included in the study. Findings from this paper could be used to introduce measures to reduce AV parking-related crashes. © 2023, Lund University Faculty of Engineering.

We explore what these distinct voices tell us about the EU's legal and policy priorities using a mega corpus compiling more than 200,000 legislative acts, 55,000 court rulings and opinions, and 4,000 articles from a leading EU law journal. Applying an unsupervised machine learning technique known as probabilistic topic modelling, we find that economic integration remains the focus of EU law, but that scholars tend to emphasize rights issues more and ignore certain topics, such as farming regulations, almost entirely. The relationship among these partly interdependent, partly autonomous voices, we suggest, can be conceptualized in terms of co-evolution. Legislation influences issue attention on the CJEU, which, in turn, influences what law professors choose to write about.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Using Chinese listed firms' data, this study measures digital transformation at the firm level from 2010 to 2020, investigating its impact on pollution emissions. The findings show that digital transformation can significantly reduce firms' pollution emissions, and the results remain robust when digital transformation is decomposed into technology-driven, application-innovative and policy-oriented digitalisation based on different calibres. Further investigation reveals that green technology innovation, factor allocation efficiency and environmental information disclosure are the potential mechanisms of digital transformation on reducing pollution emissions. Moreover, digital transformation has obvious heterogeneous effects on firms' pollution emissions based on differing external macro-environments and internal micro-characteristics, and these effects can be moderated by firms' performance evaluation and exogenous policy shocks. In addition, no evidence of a nonlinear relationship between digital transformation and firms' pollution emissions is found. These findings provide comprehensive new evidence with implications for firms and policymakers to promote digital transformation to advance pollution emissions reduction. © 2023\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Whether new technologies can reverse the trend depends on the scope of their impact and scale of their adoption—two dimensions of technical change that are historically difficult to measure. Here, we elaborate on the materials and methods presented in Alexopoulos's presidential address at the 2024 Canadian Economics Association meeting. Specifically, we discuss how applying natural language processing and text mining to library collections and cataloguing materials can help: (i) identify new technologies as they come to market and (ii) track their uses and spread over time. We further describe how our insights can be used to uncover general purpose technologies and macro-innovations in both the past and the present. An application to current data suggests that AI and robotics are responsible for an increasing share of recent technical change. Moreover, they resemble past early-stage general purpose technologies and thus do promise a reversal in productivity trends as their adoption increases. Going forward, our new methods should be especially useful to economists and policy-makers who need to track future development and adoption of key technologies—especially during periods of rapid innovation. © 2024 The Author(s).

This paper has made significant innovations and breakthroughs in policy data and policy analysis methods, analyzing the evolution characteristics of China’s tourism policy system from a new perspective. Research shows that: 1. Tourism policies are mainly based on environmental policies, lacking demand-oriented policies, and the rationality of the policy tool structure needs to be improved; 2. The tourism policy covers a comprehensive range of aspects, including macroeconomic regulation, market regulation, innovative development, and construction. Research suggests that tourism policies ensure a high-quality tourism market environment and stimulate the endogenous growth vitality of the tourism economy. In order to reshape the tourism economy in the post pandemic era, demand oriented policies should be improved. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The AILA Methodology, with its various components, applies when risk assessment proceeds exclusively upon information stated in a policy coming as a text document. This scenario is extremely common through small to medium sized institutions. Among the main contributions of this article lies the AILA Entity Extractor, which facilitates the risk assessor in the identification of entities, then of assets, from a given policy. Then, the AILA Classifier automates the assignment of likelihood values to given threats for assets. Moreover, the synergy of AILA with an existing tool for risk assessment demonstrates how to achieve more objective likelihood assignments. AILA is general in support of any risk assessment and, for the sake of demonstration, is applied to assess the privacy risk induced over physical persons by three real-world manufacturers from the automotive domain, namely Toyota, Mercedes and Tesla. AILA is also validated against a risk assessment methodology by ENISA, thereby confirming effectiveness and efficiency of the new methodology (which is dramatically more automated than ENISA's). AILA combines and consolidates together several techniques in an unprecedented fashion, including Natural Language Processing by summarisation and entity recognition, dataset labelling by appeal to the ToS;DR service, and fully-supervised Machine Learning and regression analysis. Finally, to contribute to open knowledge, the general, executable components of AILA, the AILA Entity Extractor and the AILA Classifier are released open source along with the privacy-specific components, the AILA Privacy Dataset and the AILA Privacy Model.  © 2013 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Mitigation practices of physical distancing and sheltering-in-place continue to impose a significant burden on face-to-face healthcare visits. As a result, telehealth adoption and utilization have increased significantly after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services waived telehealth payment requirements. These changes have been rapid and affect both individuals and organizations, ranging from healthcare and technology to news and policy. We turn to Twitter, as a broad-reaching communication platform, to elucidate and characterize Telehealth communication patterns. While different aspects of tweeting about telehealth have been used to answer specific questions, we sought to understand the collective telehealth tweeting behavior as a system of different types of users tweeting with various intent and sentiment. Such an approach combines the typically independent analysis of structure, using social network analysis, and purpose or function of communication, with topic analysis and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we apply a systems-based approach-called hetero-functional graph theory-to comprehensively describe the structure and function of the Twitter Telehealth communication system. We modeled 13 different types of telehealth users and 15 combinations of tweet intent and sentiment, which together describe 195 system capabilities. We applied machine learning to classify individual user tweeting behavior for different classes of telehealth stakeholders. We identified several patterns of longitudinal tweeting behaviors that varied by system form and function. By applying an interdependent methodology to understand both form and function, we provide deeper insights into tweeting behaviors between different classes of stakeholders. In doing so, we achieve a greater understanding of the various needs of different stakeholders, which can be leveraged as a valuable resource in informing more equitable policies as telehealth becomes a more permanent and scaled healthcare delivery service. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Technological innovation system (TIS) studies examined these two issues of legitimacy and guidance of innovation activities by investigating the public discourse with manual media analyses. However, these approaches are time-consuming, prone to subjectivity biases and limited in scope. Therefore, our paper proposes an automatic text analysis methodology based on unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling and lexicon-based sentiment analysis. By processing 3423 German newspaper articles from the Nexis Uni database, we cover the development of battery-electric vehicles (BEV) in Germany from 2009 to 2019 and identify five socio-technical aspects. Our results indicate an intact legitimacy for the TIS, with Usability, R&D, and Industry being legitimate aspects, which also exhibit strong or improving guidance. In contrast, the Infrastructure and Policy aspects have been less legitimate and weak in guidance, suggesting the need for more holistic policy measures and infrastructure expansion to establish a mass market. Our proposed methodology adds to the toolbox of methods to analyze TIS and serves as a monitoring tool to reveal contested aspects and periods in the public discourse. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

More than 721,000 posts collected from Sina Weibo (one of the most popular social media platforms) from January 2017 to August 2023 have been analyzed utilizing an analytical framework comprising statistical and temporal analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic analysis methods. The results reveal a consistent upward trend in public interest since 2018, with high engagement from the media, education, and institutional sectors, and greater interest from women and younger Weibo users. Economically developed regions with supportive policies and flat terrain, such as Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai, exhibit a higher level of public attention. Sentiment analysis indicates an overall positive public attitude, primarily driven by discounted monthly passes, but there are negative sentiments arising from improper parking management practices. The results are expected to be helpful for improving the SB system and informing relevant policy-making. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, in real-world situations, it can be difficult to find large datasets, particularly in the biomedical field, where it is challenging to retrieve the required material from which to derive the examples to be annotated and where a domain expert is required for annotations. To address this challenge, data augmentation can be used to generate synthetic data from an existing few-shot training set. However, current methods have a tendency to generate a vast amount of noise, thus hindering performance improvements. In this work, we propose a framework to refine a policy that allows the selection of the most informative examples in an augmented pool with a Policy-based Active Learning approach that employs a deep Q-network to define the selection strategy. We experimented the proposed approach on three benchmark biomedical datasets by simulating few-shot scenarios and found it to be more effective than the selected baselines in most of the cases. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

WHO, a global health organization agency, monitored the status of countries air pollution and health effects on human. Recently WHO provided data that depicted that about 99% of the world population lived where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were violated. As a result of global estimation, about 4.2 million premature deaths are caused by outdoor air pollution. In India 1.7 million died due to air pollution in 2019. There are numerous studies such as epidemiological, toxicological and clinicals report showed that outdoor air pollution is significantly associated with various health effects such as eye and nose irritation, allergic rhinitis, sore throat, chronic cough, bronchitis, sinusitis, chest dyspnoea, bronchial asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, reproductive disorder, effects on child cognitive function, Alzheimers disease and so many others like oxidative stress, change in gene expression etc. In this study text mining analyser was used to find out the major health effects caused by outdoor air pollution. The asthma, cardiovascular disease, coughing, COPD, other respiratory disorder, immune system damage and oxidative stress are the major health effects on human due to exposure of outdoor air pollution. The study aims to raise awareness among readers, educators, students, and policymakers about the sources and health impacts of outdoor air pollution, fostering informed decision-making and policy development for addressing this pressing issue. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

The lessons learned by Japan, the technological developments that emerged and the policy measures Japan devised to cope with its pollution are shared widely with Asian countries that now face severe water pollution associated with economic growth. However, this information has been basically qualitative in nature. In this paper we discuss the potential of using patent data and perform analyses to substantiate the insights such data can yield in order to provide more quantitative information on historical trends in the development of essential technologies in this field. Specifically, we demonstrate an approach using patent data to verify the historical development of wastewater and sewage sludge treatment technologies over the past 50 years in Japan. We examined relevant patent data from 1961 onward and addressed technological development trends in relation to societal changes and the implementation of governmental policies during that period. As an example of the substantiating analysis, we applied principal component analysis and text mining to review the trends in a systematic manner. We demonstrate that the emergence of such developments can be closely associated with societal background factors such as the adoption of relevant governmental policies. We argue that this kind of patent data analysis, coupled with other essential data, can yield clues to the evolution of relevant technologies in the past, leading to useful implications for environmental management of economically developing nations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Availability and affordance of information communications technology has provided additional medium to monitor human rights violation. Reporting, extraction, collection and verification of reports through natural language processing and machine learning techniques can now be integrated into one system. The processed narratives becomes readily available for response, monitoring, interventions, policy-making and even as evidence in court. This paper discusses the design and development of wapr.tugon.ph, a block-chain enabled NLP-based platform that provides a simple yet effective way of reporting, validating and securing human rights violation reports from victims or witnesses. wapr.tugon.ph allows for SMS-based and web-based reporting of human rights violation. Reports are processed for detection of emotions using NRCLex, and behaviors using Stanford Parser and modified Multi-Liason algorithm from narratives which serve as input to assess wellness. A total of 5,418 records were obtained from Reddit’s subreddits and HappyDB corpus to serve as baseline corpora for our model. Our best psychosocial wellness detection model produced an accuracy and F1 score of 84% on validation set (n = 1, 426) and 87% on test set (n = 666). An ethereum private blockchain is implemented to record all transactions made in the system for authenticity tracking. Findings underscore the importance of providing a system that assists in determining the appropriate psychosocial intervention to victims, families and witnesses of human rights violation. Specifically, the study contributes a framework in embedding a combined sentiment and behavior model that outputs: sentiments that are used to assess mental wellness, behaviors that are used to assess physical needs, and detection of wellness that serves as input to refer victims, families of victims and witnesses to appropriate agencies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

E-petitions may be viewed as a natural laboratory for determining subjects of public interest, and thus can be used by policy analysts to understand social needs and constraints. In this paper, we introduce textual analysis tools (such as NER and topic modeling) and extract three types of novel variables (informativeness, named entities, and 21 topics) from We the People petition texts. The regression result shows that informativeness, named location, and several topics are significantly correlated with the log of the signature counts. These exploratory but promising results indicate that textual analysis tools can complement traditional statistical methods by providing descriptive measures that are helpful for making causal inferences from electronic petition data. These new tools, we believe, will facilitate policy analysis and policy informatics by enabling meaningful use of large volumes of online archives containing public expression regarding policy preferences.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study investigates the impact of SCP symbol content on engagement, emotional responses, and trust in electoral process in TikTok-based anti-disinformation campaigns during Taiwanese 2024 general elections. Utilizing advanced natural language processing and machine learning, we analyzed posts and comments, categorizing them for presence and type of SCP symbols. We employed a multi-faceted approach, examining engagement metrics, emotional responses, and trust evaluations across different symbol categories. Our novel categorization ranged from content without symbols to those incorporating multiple symbol types, providing nuanced understanding of symbolic influence. Findings reveal a strong positive correlation between the complexity of symbolic content and user engagement, with cultural symbols emerging as potent in driving interaction and fostering trust. Emotional analysis showed symbol-rich content elicited more positive emotional responses, especially with cultural symbols. Trust evaluations showed increases in symbol diversity increased trust, with cultural and political symbols generating the highest trust levels towards Taiwan’s democratic and electoral process. Statistical validation through non-parametric tests confirmed that the observed effects were not artifacts of data distribution or follower count variations. Our findings have significant implications for public affairs, strategic communications, policymakers, and platform managers, providing a framework for crafting more effective, culturally resonant content in digital socio-political campaigns. This study also opens avenues for further research into the long-term effects of symbolic communication on political behavior and democratic participation in the digital age. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The quantity of studies done on this subject has experienced significant growth. This study aims to provide an overview of this field by conducting a systematic review of literature that focuses on automatic hate speech identification, particularly in the Arabic language. The goal is to examine the research trends in Arabic hate speech identification and offer guidance to researchers by highlighting the most significant studies published between 2018 and 2023. This systematic study addresses five specific research questions concerning the types of the Arabic language used, hate speech categories, classification techniques, feature engineering techniques, performance metrics, validation methods, existing challenges faced by researchers, and potential future research directions. Through a comprehensive search across nine academic databases, 24 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria and quality assessment were identified. The review findings revealed the existence of many Arabic linguistic varieties used in hate speech on Twitter, with modern standard Arabic (MSA) being the most prominent. In identification techniques, machine learning categories are the most used technique for Arabic hate speech identification. The result also shows different feature engineering techniques used and indicates that N-gram and CBOW are the most used techniques. F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy were also identified as the most used performance metric. The review also shows that the most used validation method is the train/test split method. Therefore, the findings of this study can serve as valuable guidance for researchers in enhancing the efficacy of their models in future investigations. Besides, algorithm development, policy rule regulation, community management, and legal and ethical consideration are other real-world applications that can be reaped from this research.

Perhaps the most well-known SEL framework is the model provided by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL). This framework has become the dominant framework informing state SEL standards, which guide educators’ SEL related practice. Yet, the content of these standards has not been formally examined for alignment with the CASEL framework. The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the content of CASEL-based state standards to explore how the CASEL framework is translated into school-based practice and to understand what SEL skills are valued by states. Using text mining and network analysis, we identified SEL standard content that was consistent across nine states and examined relationships within and across CASEL domains. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. Impact Statement Social and emotional learning (SEL) practices have grown in prominence and utility in schools across grade levels. The CASEL framework is commonly used to inform SEL intervention, assessment, and, more recently, state standards. We evaluated the content of SEL state standards created using the CASEL framework to explore how states have implemented CASEL’s model.

Methods: We conducted an observational longitudinal descriptive analysis involving 320 patients, who were grouped into intervention and control groups over a 24-month period. Results: The 3E model demonstrated significant cost reductions, with the intervention group achieving a 74.3% decrease in total costs compared to 41.8% in the control group while maintaining the same level of glycemic control. Machine learning models, including random forest and K-means clustering, were used to identify key factors influencing treatment costs and to segment patient subgroups that were most responsive to the intervention. Natural language processing techniques revealed medication patterns associated with greater cost reductions. Long-term projections using ensemble methods (such as XG Boost, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet) predicted that, on average, each year contributes approximately 20% to the total cumulative savings over 5 years. No significant correlations were observed between cost reduction and socioeconomic factors, gender, or age, suggesting the broad applicability of the 3E model. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the potential of the 3E model to achieve significant reductions in diabetes management costs without compromising care quality, highlighting its value for healthcare policy and resource allocation in chronic disease management.

This study systematically reviews 4647 journal papers to uncover evolving research themes and regional disparities in household carbon emissions research. We identified a marked increase in publications after 2015 and, using natural language processing, defined 7 distinct research clusters. While earlier studies focused primarily on energy consumption, more recent research has broadened to encompass a range of topics, including food systems, supply-chain emissions, and renewable energy. Our regional analysis reveals varied levels of research engagement across countries. The Global South is increasingly involved, focusing on cooking facilities and household energy use, whereas Europe emphasizes policy-oriented mitigation. North America, led by the United States, focuses on transportation emissions and residential energy-efficiency modeling, while Asian countries examine urban-rural disparities and household inequality. Drawing on these thematic and geographical insights, this study identifies current knowledge gaps, such as the need for cross-regional comparisons and supply chain integration. These insights offer actionable directions to promote sustainable consumption practices and support global climate goals. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Federal and state policies increasingly require plans to assess and incorporate EJ principles. The current lack of accessible data and plan evaluation on EJ has been a barrier to policy setting and benchmarking. We created a framework for analyzing content across a large corpus of plans by using quantitative text analysis on 461 California city general plans, also known as comprehensive plans. To verify results and identify specific policies, we conducted content analysis on a subset of seven plans. Demonstrating the broad applicability of EJ principles in planning, policies spanned all required elements of general plans: housing, circulation, land use, health, safety, open space, air quality, and noise. We found that the most headway in EJ planning has been made in cities with a majority population of color and well before the 2018 California state mandate to address EJ. Policies were primarily focused on preventing adverse exposures as opposed to correcting for legacies of inequality. Further, although all policies address vulnerable populations and places, very few specifically address race or racism. Thus, EJ has been largely operationalized as health equity. Takeaway for practice: We identified 628 EJ policies focused on vulnerable populations across the seven city plans included in content analysis. The smorgasbord of policy approaches provides fodder for cities across the United States to incorporate an EJ approach to planning. Gaps in focus areas reveal room for policy innovation (e.g., emphasis on language justice, formerly incarcerated individuals, and noise ordinance policing). We invite planners and community advocates to search across California’s plans for EJ policy inspiration and to use the appendix of EJ policies cataloged in this research as a benchmark of city-level innovation. © 2022 The Author(s).

Considering the uncertainty about policies, health risks, financial difficulties, etc. the online media, especially the Twitter platform, is experiencing a high volume of activity related to this pandemic. Among the hot topics, the polarized debates about unconfirmed medicines for the treatment and prevention of the disease have attracted significant attention from online media users. In this work, we present a stance data set, COVID-CQ, of user-generated content on Twitter in the context of COVID-19. We investigated more than 14 thousand tweets and manually annotated the tweet initiators’ opinions regarding the use of “chloroquine” and “hydroxychloroquine” for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, COVID-CQ is the first data set of Twitter users’ stances in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the largest Twitter data set on users’ stances towards a claim, in any domain. We have made this data set available to the research community via the Mendeley Data repository. We expect this data set to be useful for many research purposes, including stance detection, evolution and dynamics of opinions regarding this outbreak, and changes in opinions in response to the exogenous shocks such as policy decisions and events. © 2020 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Policy makers are utilizing social distancing and isolation policies to reduce the risk of transmission and spread of COVID-19, while the research, development, and testing of antiviral treatments and vaccines are ongoing. As part of these isolation policies, in-person healthcare delivery has been reduced, or eliminated, to avoid the risk of COVID-19 infection in high-risk and vulnerable populations, particularly those with comorbidities. Clinicians, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists have traditionally relied on in-person diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) and neurological conditions and illnesses. The assessment and rehabilitation of persons with acute and chronic conditions has, therefore, been particularly impacted during the pandemic. This article presents a perspective on how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), can be used to assist with assessment and rehabilitation for acute and chronic conditions. © Copyright © 2021 Carriere, Shafi, Brehon, Pohar Manhas, Churchill, Ho and Tavakoli.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Nevertheless, there are no conclusive findings on online citizen participation and inclusive policymaking. This study adds in line with the discussion with a fresh perspective of institutional bias. It presents new evidence by examining the process, participants, policy agenda, and sentiments of public opinions from the government-led and Internet-empowered citizen participation regarding the 2017–2035 Shanghai Master Plan. Four findings are reported based on the in-depth case study with text and sentiment analysis. First, the government-led model provides institutionalized opportunities for citizen engagement throughout the policy process, while the Internet-empowered citizen participation is characterized by contingency and ad hoc. Second, the government-led model remains elite-dominated, while the Internet empowers a wider scope of stakeholders with an open and popularized participation platform. Third, the public opinion from the Internet-empowered model often goes beyond or even against the pre-defined official principles and goals. In contrast, the civic discussion in the government-led model influences policy by changing the sequence of policy agenda or providing focus within the official setting. Fourth, citizens, especially the experts, are more likely to give positive feedback in the government-led model than the Internet-empowered approach. These findings confirm and identify the remaining institutional bias that hinders inclusive policymaking in the Internet age. Theoretically, it reminds scholars to examine the institutional arrangements regarding citizen participation carefully. Practically, it indicates that the central government could facilitate inclusive policymaking at the local level by reducing the institutional bias of the government-led approach and utilizing text and sentiment analysis to urge the local government's response to Internet-empowered public opinion. © 2023\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Social media platforms permit users to exchange opinions freely, which, while fostering open discourse, can also trigger instances of cyberbullying. This study focusses on Twitter discourses related to Indonesia's contentious public policy, Cipta Kerja. The inherent polarity of views towards this policy has given rise to instances of cyberbullying. An extensive dataset comprising 2400 tweets was meticulously assembled, employing the keyword Cipta Kerja. This dataset was subsequently partitioned into training and testing subsets to facilitate cyberbullying detection through computational algorithms. Sentiment analysis played a crucial role in this process, with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method demonstrating remarkable reliability in classifying sentiment-related issues and, therefore, detecting cyberbullyings. The SVM method, using a linear kernel function, achieved a commendable accuracy rate of 92.7% in cyberbullying detection. This study's results underscore the effectiveness of SVM in identifying instances of cyberbullying on social media platforms, offering new promise for safeguarding digital spaces. © 2023 WITPress.

This study quantified online negative sentiment using micro-blog text mining and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) to empirically analyze the dynamic impact of negative public emotions on agricultural product prices during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It was found that the online negative sentiment impacted agricultural products prices during COVID-19 and had significant time-varying, lag, and life cycle characteristics, with the responses being most significant in the spread and recession periods. Differences were found in the price responses for different agricultural products and in different risk areas. The online negative sentiment was found to have the greatest impact on vegetable prices, with livestock products and vegetable prices being mainly positively impacted, fruit prices being mainly negatively impacted, and aquatic product prices being negatively impacted in the early stage and positively impacted in the middle and late stages. The online negative sentiment had the greatest impact on medium-risk area agricultural product prices, followed by low-risk areas, with the lowest impact found on the high-risk area agricultural product prices. Three policy suggestions for epidemic monitoring, public opinion guidance and control, and the timely release of agricultural product information are given based on the results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Despite these advances, current human preference datasets are either prohibitively expensive to construct or suffer from a lack of diversity in preference dimensions, resulting in limited applicability for instruction tuning in open-source text-to-image generative models and hinder further exploration. To address these challenges, we first leverage multimodal large language models to create VisionPrefer, a fine-grained preference dataset that captures multiple preference aspects (prompt-following, aesthetic, fidelity, and harmlessness). Then we train a corresponding reward model, VP-Score, over VisionPrefer to guide the tuning of text-to-image generative models. The preference prediction accuracy of VP-Score is validated to be comparable to that of human annotators. To validate the effectiveness of VisionPrefer and VP-Score, we adopt two reinforcement learning methods, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), to supervised fine-tune generative models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that VisionPrefer significantly improves text-image alignment in compositional image generation across diverse aspects, e.g., aesthetic, and generalizes better than previous human-preference metrics across various image distributions. Our findings indicates that the integration of AI-generated synthetic data as a supervisory signal is a promising avenue for achieving improved alignment with human preferences in text-to-image generative models.

This theoretical construct enables an intricate examination of interactions within various environmental systems, emphasizing micro, meso, exo, macro, and chrono systems. Specifically, it illuminates the dynamics within immediate settings, interconnections among diverse systems, broader indirect influences, cultural ideologies, societal values, and temporal dimensions, offering a comprehensive lens for understanding educational contexts. The descriptive qualitative research was conducted within a case study framework to explore the practical experiences of stakeholders within ECD using semi-structured interview guides. Ethical standards were upheld, ensuring voluntary participation and confidentiality. Purposive sampling was used to collect data from diverse and knowledgeable participants involved in ECD domains, providing comprehensive insights aligned with the study’s objectives. Thematic analysis and sentiment mining were performed using Atlas 23 software. The results revealed themes such as recruitment practices relying on community-driven approaches, role ambiguity due to undefined responsibilities, informal evaluation processes, inconsistent training opportunities, and a dependency on community and volunteerism. These themes highlight the absence of formal structures and standardized processes in various aspects of ECD programs. Additionally, sentiment analysis illustrated diverse perspectives among stakeholders, reflecting their distinct experiences and challenges within the ECD landscape. The study concludes with policy recommendations aimed at addressing these systemic challenges. © 2025 Banda et al.

Focusing on the European Union, this article studies whether this is the case and, if so, when the European Commission responds to public opinion when pursuing policy integration. It argues that the Commission has legitimacy incentives encouraging it to be responsive but politicisation can suppress responsiveness by transmitting competing demands on the Commission from the member states’ citizens. To test these arguments, the contribution applied automated text analysis to estimate the European Union (EU) authority expansion entailed in the Commission’s legislative proposals between 2009 and 2019 and analysed its correspondence with public preferences over EU policy action across the EU states, measured using the Eurobarometer. The results lend support to the hypotheses and suggest that politicisation can undermine the responsiveness of international institutions. © 2024 The Author(s).

[Design/ Methodology] This paper comprehensively used the methods of network research and text mining. The content mining software, KH Coder, was employed to conduct quantitative text analysis of 79 data policies from 20 data centers. Through analyzing the frequency of FAIR principle appear in these policy texts and the words with high similarity used in FAIR principle of these policy texts, we revealed the attention difference and semantic feature of FAIR principle in different data centers and different types of policy texts. [Findings/Conclusion] The results show that the data policies of data centers have reflected some FAIR principles, but the attention to each principle is not balanced. Different types of data policies focus on different aspects of the FAIR principle, and the commonality lies in the findable principle and interoperable principle and a strong emphasis is given to metadata. [Originality/Value] This paper suggests that in the development of data policy, National Scientific Data Centers should highlight the role of metadata in data lifecycle management, promote the construction of data policy system driven by data value-added and appropriately introduce the FAIR principle based on the scientific data management practice in China. © 2024 Editorial Office of Documentation, Information and Knowledge.

Most studies of policy diffusion—which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments—have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas. ©2020, Midwest Political Science Association\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

VPA applications (or VPA apps for short) are accompanied by a privacy policy document that informs users of their data handling practices. These documents are usually lengthy and complex for users to comprehend, and developers may intentionally or unintentionally fail to comply with them. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the privacy policy compliance issue of VPA apps. We develop Skipper, which targets Amazon Alexa skills. It automatically depicts the skill into the declared privacy profile by analyzing their privacy policy documents with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, and derives the behavioral privacy profile of the skill through a black-box testing. We conduct a large-scale analysis on all skills listed on Alexa store, and find that a large number of skills suffer from the privacy policy noncompliance issues.  © 2022 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A unified quantitative analysis of policy intensity can shed light on the policy evolution across different levels, the influence of partisan and regional factors on policy, and the relationships with emissions of major pollutants. By harnessing the policy text of the Clean Air Act (CAA) at the federal level and State Implementation Plans (SIPs) at the state governments (1955–2020), we deployed a Natural Language Processing approach to define a policy intensity index to systematically quantify the US air policy landscape. Our findings highlight that the 1970 CAA amendment carries the most vigorous intensity as it established a holistic control system for the first time. Subsequent years witnessed a general trend of partisan polarization, eventually leading to a graduate convergence between red and blue states. Blue states demonstrated a closer alignment with federal directives and a superior efficacy in pollutant reduction. Regionally, the Northeast displays the highest overall policy intensity, and the West exhibits the highest coordination with the federal benchmarks, making these regions outperform others in air pollution control. Our study not only discusses policy implications for air pollutant reductions considering partisan and regional differences but also provides a novel measurement tool to quantify policies for assessing disparities and synergies. © The Author(s) 2024.

In the past decades, a large number of academic articles in the maritime transport field have been published. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the development of maritime transport research. A structural topic model (STM) is adopted to analyze the research themes and trends in the maritime literature. STM is a text mining-based methodology to uncover main topics from large-scale unstructured textual data. In total, 3199 articles published between Jan 1991 and Aug 2020 were collected and analyzed. The results show that the major academic concerns of maritime transport are related to port management, container operations and liner shipping management. The overall research trends have shifted from regulations and policy management to efficient, integrated and sustainable maritime transport over the past few decades. The main research topics and emerging trends discovered from STM can facilitate researchers, funding groups and policymakers for identifying contemporary research issues and making more informed decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using new data and state-of-the-art methodology, our study provides a fresh perspective on this fundamental question. We focus on a multi-party parliamentary system, specifically the Canadian House of Commons, with a specific emphasis on the issue of climate change. To assess the attention given by political parties to various policy issues, we analyze transcripts from the Question Period spanning from April 2006 to June 2021. To gauge the public’s level of concern for these issues, we incorporate data obtained from Google Trends. Employing an instrumental variable estimation strategy, our study causally estimates the extent to which the public salience of climate change influences elite attention. Our findings reveal that the public salience of climate change significantly influences the attention given to this issue by parties, albeit with noticeable partisan variations. Moreover, our research highlights the effectiveness of the Question Period in compelling the government to address challenging or potentially embarrassing issues. Lastly, we uncover evidence suggesting that the Liberal Party of Canada successfully increased the public salience of climate change during its tenure in government. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Quantitative analysis of policies related to rural digital construction can provide important bases for the formulation and improvement of policies in the future. This paper adopts text mining method and combines social network analysis to study 213 digital village construction policy texts issued by national government departments from 2007 to 2021, and deeply analyzes the content characteristics and evolution rules of such policies. The results show that several small cooperative groups have been formed among the policy issuing agencies. They gradually refine the specific arrangements and measures of rural digitization construction on the basis of division of labor and cooperation. With the promotion of digital information technology, the government's formulation of policies related to rural digital construction has formed a change process from point to point. The policy focus has changed from agriculture to smart agriculture, emerging industry and information service industry, making the policy coverage more comprehensive and more in line with the actual situation of local villages. In the future, policies related to digital village construction pay more attention to the difficulties of development and the consolidation of construction achievements while comprehensively developing.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We extract the sentences that were removed or rewritten in that edit. The approach yields sufficient data even in the case of relatively small Wikipedias, such as the Bulgarian one, where 62k articles produced 5k biased sentences. We evaluate our method by manually annotating 520 sentences for Bulgarian and French, and 744 for English. We assess the level of noise and analyze its sources. Finally, we exploit the data with well-known classification methods to detect biased sentences.

However, it is difficult but critical to measure the effectiveness of these policies. This paper proposed a quantitative evaluation approach to the effectiveness of construction industrialization policies, based on five policies passed from 2014 to 2017. These policies were first quantified through text mining. Then, the policy modeling consistency (PMC) index was employed to inform the effectiveness and efficiency of the studied policies. Findings of this paper can be used as references for policy making in construction industrialization. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Gendered Media Coverage of the 2020 Democratic Party Presidential Primaries\n                    ABSTRACT: In the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary campaigns, six women, the most in history, announced their candidacy for the presidency. Using computational topic modeling and network analysis of 84,000 newspaper articles (2.2 million paragraphs), we analyze how gender and electability was discussed during the Primaries. Results reveal that male candidates, and especially Joe Biden, were frequently compared with the incumbent, Donald Trump, while coverage of female candidates focused directly on social policy. Trump’s attack on Biden during the impeachment process produced a lasting effect by promoting discourse topics traditionally dominated by men. This crowded out the topics emphasized by women, such as health care and education. Women candidates’ press coverage was also more reactionary than men’s. Although explicit reference to gender as a discourse topic has decreased, which suggests growing gender parity within the political process, gendered policy salience emerges transitively in comparison with the incumbent. Transitive policy salience emerges as a key explanatory variable that articulates the indirect path media coverage can lead to the marginalization of women candidates. © 2023 AEJMC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, there is a lack of scientific evaluation on the rationality and completeness of the provincial special public funding policy of China s private colleges and universities. Therefore, this paper uses PMC-index model and text mining technology to establish an evaluation index system for the provincial special public funding policy of private universities in China. Based on PMCIndex and PMC-Surface, 13 policy texts issued since 2010 were evaluated scientifically. The results show that the average PMC-Index of the 13 policies is 6.97, and the PMC-Surface map is smooth, which indicates that the overall structure of these policies is reasonable and the policy content has certain completeness. Only one policy is unacceptable. Through further analysis, we found that there is still much room for improvement in the content design of the sample policy, and its rationality and completeness are related to the publication time. This study is helpful to fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the provincial special public funding policy of private universities in China. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

This imbalance often favors industries, forcing users to repeatedly define their privacy preferences each time they access a new website. This process contributes to the privacy paradox. We propose a user support tool named the User Privacy Preference Management System (UPPMS) that eliminates the need for users to handle intricate banners or deceptive patterns. We have set up a process to guide even a non-expert user in creating a standardized personal privacy policy, which is automatically applied to every visited website by interacting with cookie banners. The process of generating actions to apply the user’s policy leverages customized Large Language Models. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing HTML code to understand and automatically interact with cookie banners, even implementing complex policies. Our proposal aims to address the privacy paradox related to cookie banners by reducing information overload and decision fatigue for users. It also simplifies user navigation by eliminating the need to repeatedly declare preferences in intricate cookie banners on every visited website, while protecting users from deceptive patterns. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Aside from the usual numeric ratings obtained from the survey, the hierarchical concerns and sentiments can also be identified through the text-based customer feedbacks. These feedbacks contain text about customer experiences with the products offered and services delivered by an institution. A challenge in analyzing unstructured customer feedback is in making sense of the topics that are expressed in words used to describe these experiences. This study develops a model for text analysis of the customer feedbacks that exploits machine learning algorithms such as topic modeling. This further described the text mining process steps undergone in extracting useful information from the customer survey feedbacks of one of the SUCs in the Philippines, The Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology (BISCAST). Moreover, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling method, was used for automatic text summarization and topic extraction from these text-based data. The topmost concerns extracted from the feedbacks were identified. This information provides useful insights for management analysis as well as inputs for policy making. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The impact of Covid-19 has spread to Indonesia, especially in the slowdown in economic growth. This was influenced by the implementation of Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM) which limited community economic activities. This study analyzes the mapping of public sentiment towards PPKM policies in Indonesia during the pandemic based on Twitter data. Knowing the mapping of public sentiment regarding PPKM is expected to help stakeholders in the policy evaluation process for each region. The method used is BERT with IndoBERT specific model. The results showed the evaluation value of the IndoBERT f-1 score reached 84%, precision 86%, and recall 84%. Meanwhile, f-1 scores 70%, 72% precision, and 70% recall for evaluating the use of SVM. Multinominal Naïve Bayes evaluation shows an f-1 score of 83%, precision of 78%, and recall of 80%. In conclusion, the BERT method with the IndoBERT model is proven to be higher than classical methods such as SVM and Multinominal Naïve Bayes. © 2022 Seventh Sense Research Group®\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Swiss National Railways (SBB) uses Facebook to collect commuters’ feedback and opinions. These customer feedbacks are highly valuable to make public transportation option more robust and gain trust of the customer. The objective of this study was to find interesting association rules about SBB’s commuters pain points. We extracted the publicly available FB visitor comments and applied manual text mining by building categories and subcategories on the extracted data. We then applied Apriori algorithm and built multiple frequent item sets satisfying the minsup criteria. Interesting association rules were found. These rules have shown that late trains during rush hours, deleted but not replaced connections on the timetable due to SBB’s timetable optimization, inflexibility of fines due to unsuccessful ticket purchase, led to highly customer discontent. Additionally, a considerable amount of dissatisfaction was related to the policy of SBB during the initial lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic. Commuters were often complaining about lack of efficient and effective measurements from SBB when other passengers were not following Covid-19 rules like public distancing and were not wearing protective masks. Such rules are extremely useful for SBB to better adjust its service and to be better prepared by future pandemics. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The discussion surrounding the application of LLMs in education has raised ethical concerns, particularly concerning plagiarism and policy compliance. Despite the prowess of LLMs in conversational tasks, the limitations of reliability and hallucinations exacerbate the need to guardrail conversations, motivating our investigation of RAG in computer science higher education. We developed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications for the two tasks of virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids. In our study, we collected the ratings and opinions of faculty members in undergraduate and graduate computer science university courses at various levels, using our personalized RAG systems for each course. This study is the first to gather faculty feedback on the application of LLM-based RAG in education. The investigation revealed that while faculty members acknowledge the potential of RAG systems as virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids, certain barriers and features are suggested for their full-scale deployment. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the integration of advanced language models in educational settings, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and the development of appropriate safeguards to ensure responsible and effective implementation. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To address these complexities, a vendor-agnostic, logical, and abstract view of the infrastructure is essential. Intent-based networking (IBN) helps address complexity by providing a set of abstractions (e.g., functional, data, infrastructure), but the intelligent and automatic decomposition of an intent into a course of actions is a challenging task. In this article, we propose a policy-based approach to model functional abstractions, and decompose intents into a hierarchy of policies. We use closed control loop automation, guided by Finite State Machines (FSM) to execute the policies and deploy the intents. To make our approach widely applicable, we provide a mapping to the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Policy Driven Orchestration (PDO) model. We also discuss opportunities for IBN in large language models, and demonstrate our system through a cloud intent that includes a VNF and a health check service.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This work has, however, neglected the question of corporate identity from the perspective of co-operatives—democratically-controlled businesses owned and controlled by their users—and the existential challenge posed by an operating environment often hostile to the business model. At the same time, the question of identity permeates the scholarly organizational and co-operative literature, shaping studies into co-operative identity crises, isomorphism, and from a transactions-cost economics perspective, the co-operative lifecycle. Bridging these literatures, we develop a first-ever conceptual dictionary of terms that we associate with co-operative and investor-owned firms (IOFs). Using text-as-data techniques, we apply the dictionary to a 15-year sample of credit union (a type of co-operative) and bank (IOFs) annual report texts. The resulting model ranks credit unions and banks on a co-op versus IOF firm scale and identifies credit unions that may be at risk of losing their identity because of their use of IOF language. To validate our results, we employ a variety of strategies, including novel machine learning models. Generally, these strategies support the findings from our dictionary model but also suggest the model may not be picking up on some creeping isomorphic pressures on credit unions to conform to IOF language. We conclude by noting that identity questions have important real-world implications, noting potential legal and public policy implications (e.g., loss of preferential tax measures) and pointing to literature that associates co-operative “identity crises” with business failures and demutualizations which, in turn, can lead to higher consumer prices. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic modelling analyses to examine the evolution and trajectory of the climate justice literature. We analyse 1,683 publications covering the period from 1997 to 2021, highlighting foundational works, influential authors, leading nations and institutions, and prevailing research topics within this field. We employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover latent research trends in the literature providing a crucial baseline for future scholarly endeavours and policy development in the realm of climate justice. Our results show that the field of climate justice has grown exponentially from less than 5 papers annually between 1997 and 2005, to around 200 papers annually in recent years. This growth has seen a diversification of research themes with an increase in papers around the topics of health, vulnerability and adaptation, and policy and activism. There has been a consistent backdrop of publications around the topics of sustainable development and policy, and international relations and carbon emissions. Other prominent topics in the literature include education and food security, and human rights and Indigenous people. The field has moved from theoretical research to examining actual examples of climate injustices, with an increased diversification of topics. Future research could usefully focus on exploring future generations and more-than-human entities; the integration of climate justice and climate activism with broader struggles for justice; re-thinking climate adaptation “success” and “effectiveness” through the lens of climate justice, and the ramifications of the Global Goal on Adaptation on climate justice led-approaches that are inclusive, build on human rights approaches, and extend the scale of adaptation analysis beyond the local. It is imperative to prioritise addressing the climate justice needs of those most affected by climate change, transcending national borders, generational gaps, cultural differences, and even the well-being of various species. Such a holistic approach will help inform and refine global climate policy and action. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This article not only leverages the reinforcement learning multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to realize the dynamic decision-making of game AI but also creatively incorporates deep learning and natural language processing technologies in the wargame field to transform game context situation maps into textual suggestions in wargame confrontation. In this article, we effectively integrate reinforcement learning technologies, deep learning technologies, and natural language processing technologies to generalize the semantic text output at state-of-the-art accuracy, which plays an important role in human understanding of game AI behavior. The experimental results are promising and can be used to verify the feasibility, accuracy, and performance of our proposed model in extensive simulations against benchmarking methods. © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Existing research has explored open government data policies from various perspectives, but little attention has been given to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of policy narratives. [Method / process] In this study, we take the example of the United States open government data policy and employ a structural topic model approach to identify policy topics. Subsequently, we use a narrative policy framework to analyze the policy narratives from four dimensions: background, plot, characters, and moral. We also examine the homogeneity and heterogeneity of policy narratives between the federal government and state governments in the United States. [Result / conclusion] The research findings indicate that there are five main policy narratives concerning the US open government data policy, and regional differences in policy narratives exist due to varying economic development levels, geographical locations, and other factors. © 2025 Information studies: Theory and Application.

Where less significant development can be observed is in the area of sponsorship evaluation. This paper outlines a specific company case study focusing on a relatively new, but now well-established brand, which made a significant strategic choice in utilizing sponsorship for brand building, market penetration, and the acquisition and retention of consumers in an increasingly commodified service category in contrast to the strategic mix chosen by its main competitors. The paper provides a detailed focus on the management and evaluation of their sponsorship activity in one particular market. Following a brief introduction to the O2 brand and its international development, it will examine the brand's position in the Irish marketplace and the strategically chosen role for sponsorship in its armory of marketing options. It details the key strategic pillars, which underpin the approach to sponsorship as a set of beliefs that hold sponsorship policy and activation together. The challenge, in a mature market dominated by competition for market share, was to drive short-term sales while building long-term brand equity. The industry was experiencing a paradigm shift from mobile operators to social networks and the paper explains how the choice and activation of sponsorships sought to develop participative interaction with customers to promote emotionally driven loyalty. To make the brand the basis for differentiation the company chose a marketing mix weighted toward sponsorship and placed participation at the core of activation. The strategic choices involved regarding the balance of resources between paid-for media and sponsorship and in the latter case, between assets and activation, are explored. Two case studies relating to sport and entertainment sponsorship are detailed with particular reference to innovative and creative activation through social networks. The paper will outline the use of quantitative tracking measures as well as more involved measures in evaluating sponsorship performance. More specifically it will focus on the measurement of sponsorship performance and in particular on the various points at which measurement is brought to bear and the range of metrics-including softer measures such as sentiment analysis and social media conversations-utilized in this evaluation process. It will thus arrive at a comprehensive approach to measuring sponsorship effectiveness and demonstrate how results are translatable to monetary values. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In reality, these concepts might prioritize certain groups over others. Based on interdisciplinary theories of androcentrism, we hypothesized that (a) person is more associated with men than women (person = man) and (b) woman is more associated with women than man is with men (i.e., women are more gendered: gender = woman). We applied natural language processing tools (specifically, word embeddings) to the linguistic output of millions of individuals (specifically, the Common Crawl corpus). We found the hypothesized person = man / gender = woman bias. This bias was stronger about Hispanic and White (vs. Asian) women and men. We also uncovered parallel biases favoring White individuals in the concepts person, woman, and man. Western society prioritizes men and White individuals as people and “others” women as people with gender, with implications for equity across policy- and decision-making contexts. © 2024 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since knowledge exploration is a resource-intensive task for organizations, untimely or excessive knowledge exploration have detrimental impacts on the innovativeness and competitiveness of organizations. The benefits of performance measurement and management tools for knowledge management in organizations have been known for many years now. Therefore, the application of similar tools in ecosystems may enable actors to have access to valuable external knowledge. However, there is a paucity of such tools in management scholarship. The purpose of this study is to bridge this gap by proposing a conceptual tool - the Ecosystem Knowledge (EK) Explorer, which generates insightful knowledge for ecosystem actors using codified technical knowledge (e.g., scientific publications and patents). Not only does the EK Explorer reduce the uncertainty and fuzziness of the knowledge exploration phase for ecosystem actors, it also enables them to save resources and have access to strategic knowledge regarding competition, collaboration, technology management, and policy making in ecosystems. Bibliometric analysis, social network analysis, and text mining were used to conceptualize the constructs and measurable variables of the EK Explorer. © 2019 Carleton University.

Evidencia de las contribuciones determinadas a nivel nacional de Brasil para la COP21]\n                    ABSTRACT: Participation in democratic regimes has been a central issue in foreign policy (FP) studies. This article seeks to contribute to the empirical discussion about FP participation through the analysis of the public consultation process conducted by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with non-state actors in the context of the preparations for the Paris Climate Agreement (2015). We employed automated text analysis using Python and R qualifying open responses submitted to the questionnaire launched at the first round of the consultations process and comparing them to the official document presented by Brazil establishing its own carbon emission targets. We found that the Brazilian academia members had a relevant influence on the content of the final document presented by Brazil, strengthening the literature on the importance of the epistemic community to environmental politics and raising new questions on the paths of foreign policy influence. © The Author(s) 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

First, she uses automated text analysis to identify climate change frames in interest groups’ press releases (N 5 1,768), coding frames for features believed to heighten cultural resonance. Then, she uses plagiarism-detection software to identify which messages were publicized in three major newspapers, 1985–2014. She finds that policy messages from structurally powerful interest groups such as business coalitions have received disproportionate media attention in the US climate debate. However, organizational resources alone are not deter-minative of messages’ success. Political messages are also more likely to receive visibility when they leverage sources of cultural power, such as by appealing to the latent worldviews of American audiences or their pragmatic concerns at particular historical moments. Results suggest both cultural and organizational power have shaped the perspectives given visibility in the American climate change debate, while also de-scribing limits on either form of power to determine media discourse. © 2023 The University of Chicago.

Although many studies extensively explored the role of corporate language policy in large corporations, employees' perceptions of such policy has not been explored adequately. Fewer studies investigate the trends in such perceptions in social media texts. This study fills this gap; it examines the barriers in multinational companies that have adopted a foreign language and analyses employees' attitudes. The study uses computer-assisted text analysis to investigate changes in employees' perceptions of an English-only policy in Rakuten, a Japanese company. It analyses a corpus of 704 social media posts on OpenWork from 2010 to 2018. The study finds some trends in employees' attitudes such as the inconsistency between expectation and reality in terms of ‘Englishnization’ and the popularity of the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC). The findings suggest that Rakuten is not global in the true sense; the value of the TOEIC score is overestimated and the neoliberal employment system affects employees in complex ways. This study contributes to international business language with a bottom-up, employee-centred, and diachronic perspective on language management. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The objectives of this study include (1) determining the important aspects of the international anime tourism experience; (2) comparing between international Eastern and Western anime tourists’ experiences; (3) understanding the sentiments behind the online reviews posted by international anime tourists. In total, 33 sub-themes and 12 themes across 3 key dimensions–cognitive, affective, and conative, were unveiled by coding undertaken by three researchers. Among Eastern and Western tourists, the aspects related to communication, expectations, service, anime authenticity seeking, and destination information were rated noticeably differently. Practitioners are urged to investigate existing ticket purchasing processes, photo policy, food options and quality, and communication, to better serve the international anime tourists. © 2022 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study developed a sentiment analysis using millions of Twitter data during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 10 metropolitan cities in Italy’s (1) north: Milan, Venice, Turin, Bologna; (2) central: Florence, Rome; (3) south: Naples, Bari; and (4) islands: Palermo, Cagliari. Questions addressed are as follows: (1) How did tweet-related sentiments change over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) How did sentiments change when lagged with policy shifts and/or specific events? Findings show an assortment of differences and connections across Twitter sentiments (fear, anger, and joy) based on policy measures and geographies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results can be used by policy makers to quantify the satisfactory level of positive/negative acceptance of decision makers and identify important topics related to COVID-19 policy measures, which can be useful for imposing geographically varying lock-downs and protective measures using historical data. © 2022 by the authors.

We gather a series of interesting facts and relationships using a variety of data mining techniques. In particular, we concentrate on attributes relevant to the user ratings of movies, such as discovering if big-budget films are more popular than their low budget counterparts, if any relationship between movies produced during the golden age (i.e. Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, etc.) can be proved, and whether any particular actors or actresses are likely to help a movie to succeed. The paper also reports on the techniques used, giving their implementation and usefulness. We have found that the IMDb is difficult to perform data mining upon, due to the format of the source data. We also found some interesting facts, such as the budget of a film is no indication of how well-rated it will be, there is a downward trend in the quality of films over time, and the director and actors/actresses involved in a film are the most important factors to its success or lack thereof. The data used in this paper is not freely distributable, but remains copyright to the Internet Movie Database inc. It is used here within the terms of their copying policy.

Classically, this involves generating completions from the LLM in response to a query before using a separate reward model to assign a score to the full completion. As an auto-regressive process, the LLM has to take many “actions” (selecting individual tokens) and only receives a single, sparse reward at the end of an episode, a setup that is known to be difficult to optimise in traditional reinforcement learning. In this work we leverage the fact that the reward model contains more information than just its scalar output, in particular, it calculates an attention map over tokens as part of the transformer architecture. We use these attention weights to redistribute the reward along the whole completion, effectively densifying the signal and highlighting the most important tokens, all without incurring extra computational cost or requiring any additional modelling. We demonstrate that, theoretically, this approach is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirically, we show that it stabilises training, accelerates the rate of learning, and, in practical cases, may lead to better local optima.

The extent of regional variation in its local government strategies, however, has been neglected. In this article, we make this enquiry through comparison of two municipalities run by the RN between 2014 and 2020. While similar in local demand and central party supply, the municipalities differ in their socio-economic context and political history. We ask if the party has responded to these contrasting contexts with different strategies of governing. We conduct a qualitative analysis of the policies introduced in both towns and draw on semi-structured interviews with government and opposition actors. In addition, we conduct a quantitative text analysis of their policy agendas, using a dictionary-based analysis to measure the extent of populist radical right ideology in each case. Our findings show that, as well as some limited regional variation in the prominence of their core ideological themes, there is a common emphasis from both on a governing style characterised by ‘pragmatism’. We argue that the prioritisation of the national party aim of mainstreaming can be a force for the nationalisation of local governing strategies from populist radical right parties, as shown here in the case of the RN. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This is the first case of COVID-19 officially confirmed in that country. Several cases have continued to increase since then. President Jokowi began issuing policies on the spread of this virus. This is different from other countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore, which responded from the previous month when the Indonesian government still stated that coronavirus does not exist in Indonesia. Our case study is to find a public opinion through social network analysis of Indonesian public policy during the beginning of the Indonesian COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. This research implements text mining and document-based sentiments on Twitter data that is reprocessed through machine learning techniques using the Naïve Bayes method. We found negative opinions in the period more dominant by 46%, while that was 35% positive sentiment and 20% neutral. This research shows that anticipation, sadness, and anger are very dominant in the emotional analysis.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study used text mining and the Policy Modeling Consistency (PMC) Index model to develop an evaluation system of Municipal Solid Waste sorting management policies that included 10 first-level variables and 51 second-level variables to quantitatively evaluate the texts of waste sorting management policies in 11 major cities, and then the PMC surface of policy texts was constructed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of individual policies according to the PMC index values. The results revealed that there were no excellent level or bad level policies among the 11 policies, with an average PMC index value of 7.71. Overall, the 11 policy texts all set out clear goals and programs in accordance with local conditions, but there are some differences across policies in terms of indicators, including policy content, policy function, policy evaluation, restriction and incentives. This study provides a fresh viewpoint on the policy evaluation of waste sorting management and offers some insight for policymakers, who should pay attention to waste separation, focus on key indicators of the policy, and enhance the effectiveness of the policy response. In addition, the applicability of the evaluation model and the difficulties associated with waste sorting governance of China in post-epidemic are discussed.

This longitudinal text-mining study investigates the relationship between topics mentioned in news articles and reader comments published the online news outlets nytimes.com (USA) and spiegel.de (Germany) from 2007 to 2020. Topics are modeled using a neural network approach based on clustered multilingual sentence embeddings. Results show that the salience of topics in news articles significantly influences their salience in reader comments but not vice versa. Metrics for agenda distance and agenda diversity confirm the media's agenda-setting role and additionally point out periods of time when events caused the media and public attention to diverge. The news media drives public opinion on organic food in the US and Germany by determining the discussion topics and is thus an important player in the promotion of organic food consumption to be considered by marketers and policy makers. © 2022\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, many of those who could have benefited from psychological or pharmacological treatments fail to be recognized or treated due to the lack of timely recognition and accurate diagnosis. Objective: This study used a topic modeling approach to explore people’s anxiety-related concerns raised on a computer-mediated Chinese health platform, YOU WEN BI DA (questioning and answering), to provide implications for accurate diagnosis, targeted education, tailored intervention, and informed policy-making in the course of addressing this condition of public concern. Methods: First, we extracted data from YOU WEN BI DA between May 2022 and February 2023. After cleaning the extracted data both using the Python text processing tool spaCy and manually, we ascertained the optimal number of topics by drawing on the coherence scores and used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to generate the most salient topics and related terms. We then categorized the topics ascertained into different classes of themes by plotting them onto a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling using the pyLDAvis visualization tool. Finally, we analyzed these topics and themes qualitatively to better understand people’s anxiety-related concerns. Results: 5 topics with different overall prevalence were ascertained through data analysis. Topic 2 (tinnitus phobia-incurred concerns, n = 639) is the most popular dominant topic, occurring in 25.1% of the 2545 collected concerns, closely followed by Topics 1 (neurosis-incurred concerns, n = 512;) and 3 (sleep, dyskinesia, bipolar, cognitive, and somatic disorders-incurred concerns, n = 619), which appeared in 20.1% and 24.3% of the 2545 concerns respectively. Topic 5 (social phobia-incurred concerns, n = 428) ranks as the fourth most popular dominant topic, showing up in 16.8% of the 2545 concerns. Topic 4 (autonomic nerve dysfunction-incurred concerns, n = 347) accounts for 13.6% of the 2545 concerns. The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding analysis reveals partial similarities between Topics 2 and 5 as well as between Topics 4 and 5 because many concerns involved in Topics 2 and 5 pertain to people’s psychological status of fear and anxiety and the relief and dispelling of such symptoms through medication, and many concerns involved in Topics 4 and 5 relate to people’s worries about the negative impact on their nerves and the adjustment and conditioning of such effects through medication. Conclusion: This was the first study that investigated Chinese people’s anxiety-related concerns raised on YOU WEN BI DA using the topic modeling technique. The automatic text analysis and complementary manual interpretation of the collected data allowed for the discovery of the dominant topics hidden in the data and the categorization of these topics into different themes to reveal the overall status of people’s anxiety-related concerns. The research findings can provide some practice implications for health and medical educators, practitioners, and policy-makers to make joint efforts to address this common public concern effectively and efficiently. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In Canada, a novel mechanism for both increasing incentives and information provision has been developed in recent decades: the mandate letter. These letters are issued by Canadian prime ministers to their ministers, reinforcing government priorities, each minister's responsibilities, and specific policy expectations. This article examines mandate letters as mechanisms inducing interministerial policy co-ordination, focusing on the 2015-2021 period, under Justin Trudeau, as the first Canadian prime minister to release these letters publicly. Using topic modelling and social network analysis, I find that Trudeau has increasingly sought to strengthen ministerial co-ordination and ministers' focus on crosscutting policy priorities. This case study contributes to our understanding of intraexecutive co-ordination and the agency problem in cabinet government.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Since emotions play a critical role in decision making according to the psychological domain of emotion science, the paramount importance of periodic delineation of stakeholders' mood is imperative for policy makers. Whereas opinion mining analytics of IoT discussions have returned state-of-the-arts, there is need to address germane factors seldom factored into existing literatures. This study therefore consolidates on current frameworks through a bi-modal descriptive and content-based analytics of IoT ecosystem for detecting key mood domain and the BlueCheckCredibility status of IoT tweeters using Profile of Mood State and Nomogram-based analytics. With a 99.5% precision rate by Logistic regression model, social characteristic attributes of acquired ethnographic data points turns mutually exclusive to the credibility status of IoT opinion molders while tweet properties contributes higher discriminative tendencies for identifying negative IoT emotions.

Vaccination, recognized as a pivotal measure in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19, has evoked a diverse range of sentiments worldwide. In particular, numerous users on social media platforms have expressed concerns regarding vaccine availability and potential side effects. Therefore, it is imperative for governmental authorities and senior health policy strategists to gain insights into the public's perspectives on vaccine mandates in order to effectively implement their vaccination initiatives. Despite the critical importance of comprehending the underlying factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine sentiment, the existing literature offers limited research studies on this subject matter. This paper presents an innovative methodology that harnesses Twitter data to extract sentiment pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination through the utilization of Artificial Intelligence techniques such as sentiment analysis, entity detection, linear regression, and logistic regression. The proposed methodology was applied and tested on live Twitter feeds containing COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets, spanning from February 14, 2021, to April 2, 2023. Notably, this approach successfully processed tweets in 45 languages originating from over 100 countries, enabling users to select from an extensive scenario space of approximately 3.55 × 10249 possible scenarios. By selecting specific scenarios, the proposed methodology effectively identified numerous determinants contributing to vaccine sentiment across iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. In comparison to previous studies documented in the existing literature, the presented solution emerges as the most robust in detecting the fundamental drivers of vaccine sentiment and demonstrates the vaccination sentiments over a substantially longer period exceeding 24 months. © 2023 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The objective is to investigate the development and evolution of renewable energy policies in China and to gain insights into the national-level attitudes towards renewable energy development. The study consists of two phases: initially, renewable energy policy documents undergo keyword analysis using word clouds and keyword co-occurrence network analysis to elucidate the focal areas and their interconnections within the legal and policy texts. Subsequently, after determining the optimal number of topics for modelling based on topic perplexity and consistency results, the text undergoes data cleaning to isolate words with practical significance. These words are then incorporated into the LDA topic model to analyze the distribution and content of potential topics within the policies. Lastly, by linearly segmenting the time frame, changes in topic intensity over time are visually examined using heat maps. The findings indicate that energy policies have consistently prioritized “development” and emphasized the significance of “new energy” in renewable energy policies. Moreover, as renewable energy has progressed, governments and policymakers have come to acknowledge the importance of comprehensive energy planning, transitioning to clean energy sources, and regulating the electricity market. This growing awareness has led to efforts to strengthen policy and regulatory measures to foster renewable energy's sustainable development and utilization. In summary, this study highlights the effectiveness of the LDA topic model in analyzing renewable energy policies, advancing its adoption and furthering research in the field. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

RLHF methods achieve successes in aligning LLM responses with human preferences and improving the controllability of LLM behavior with human instruction. However, RLHF methods are considerably complicated to implement, computationally expensive to train, and notoriously tricky to tune. In this work, we propose Alignment with Residual Energy-Based Model (ARM), as a simple and flexible alternative to RLHF methods. Our method is driven by an observation that we can learn an aligned policy by minimizing a forward Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence from a target policy (in the form of a residual energy-based model) to a parameteric policy (LLM), instead of a reverse KL as in RLHF methods. With samples from the energy-based target policy, we can leverage the power of DPO (or other offline methods) to learn an aligned policy efficiently. ARM is simple to implement and applicable in various data settings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate its strong performance across multiple datasets, compared to strong baselines like PPO, DPO. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In recent years, it has enabled massive breakthroughs in computer vision and natural language processing. But leveraging these advances for optimal control has proved difficult. Data is a key limiting factor. Without access to the optimal policy, value function, or demonstrations, how can we fit a policy? In this paper, we show how to automatically generate supervised learning data for a class of continuous-time nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems. In particular, applying the Feynman-Kac theorem to a linear reparameterization of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE allows us to sample the value function by simulating a stochastic process. Hardware accelerators like GPUs could rapidly generate a large amount of this training data. With this data in hand, stochastic optimal control becomes supervised learning.  © 2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Although 4th IR relevant technologies may have positive impacts in many fields, they may also create harmful impacts, just as every previous industrial revolution has. Most studies dealing with the 4th IR have focused on its positive impacts; the present research concentrates on its negative impacts and suggests technological opportunities to hedge against expected risks in the future. To this end, future societal topics are first identified through latent Dirichlet allocation based topicmodeling using textual information of futuristic data,which is retrieved fromthe website, including information on future-related insights. Second, the risk topics related to the future are selected with the help of a weighting score using predefined risk keywords and sentiment analysis. Finally, safe technological opportunities are identified based on textual information derived from patent data related to risk topics with the perspectives on risk analysis that have prior (prediction, prevention) and posterior perspectives (response, recovery). To illustrate technology relevant to the 4th IR, artificial intelligence (AI) is selected. As a result, 36 topics related to future society and six future risk-related topics are suggested that reflects security-relevant properties of AI and three types of threats. Opportunities to ensure or safety through technology are also proposed in four perspectives. Technological opportunities related to safety are explored in two perspectives. One is to expand existing threats, and the other is to suggest new threats. This research can be utilized to plan future safety technology by taking a data-driven approach under the huge paradigm shift of the 4th IR and proposing potential technological solutions that are not future societal scenarios and policy solutions suggested in the previous studies. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, the representation capability of existing deep topic models is still limited by the phenomenon of “posterior collapse”, which has been widely criticized in deep generative models, resulting in the higher-level latent representations exhibiting similar or meaningless patterns. To this end, in this paper, we first develop a novel deep-coupling generative process for existing deep topic models, which incorporates skip connections into the generation of documents, enforcing strong links between the document and its multi-layer latent representations. After that, utilizing data augmentation techniques, we reformulate the deep-coupling generative process as a Markov decision process and develop a corresponding Policy Gradient (PG) based training algorithm, which can further alleviate the information reduction at higher layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our developed methods can effectively alleviate “posterior collapse” in deep topic models, contributing to providing higher-quality latent document representations. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), renowned as an international hub for tourism and entertainment, has actively responded to the crisis. However, a comprehensive analysis detailing the evolution of Macao SAR’s policies throughout this period is currently lacking. Methods: This study aims to comprehensively understand the decision-making processes, policy formulation, and implementation strategies of the Macao SAR government amidst the pandemic through the analysis of speeches and inquiries made by legislative council members and other relevant documents. Employing both quantitative and qualitative analytical methods, including word frequency analysis and word vector models, we identify key themes and patterns. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis of keyword frequencies during the two waves of the pandemic using radar charts. Results: The results indicate a heightened focus by the Macao SAR government on pandemic control measures and economic impacts. In response, the government formulated and implemented policies, provided support initiatives, and managed port clearance, all while focusing on enhancing healthcare infrastructure and community services. Conclusions: The government persistently amends its policies in response to the evolving challenges posed by the pandemic. The evolution of the dynamic Zero-COVID strategy highlights the government’s adaptability and comprehensive consideration, ensuring public health and societal stability. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

It tracks the answer to a couple of questions: Does the content of economic policy direction change every year in a more stable macroeconomic environment? If it changes, how can this be explained by theory? To investigate these changes, Korean annual economic policy direction reports released from the Ministry of the Interior were collected. Through text mining and correspondence analysis, the words in the reports over 16 years (from 2001 to 2016) were examined. The analytical results show that policy elites constantly compete to influence the policy package by putting themselves in the past to maintain and acquire legitimate authority while responding to the government's needs for creative innovation and change. © 2017 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, we propose a method to identify the urban regions and analyze their spatial-temporal features based on trajectory data mining and POIs (point of interest) semantic analysis. Through taking the correlation between vehicle running conditions and func-tions of regions into account, the characteristic points in trajectory data are clustered adaptively based on their densities. The functional areas are divided reasonably through building Voronoi diagrams based on the cluster centers. In order to effectively evaluate the compositional functions of the regions, the topic words are mined and the corresponding probabilities are calculated based on the POIs’ categories in each region, using LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. Furthermore, we propose a quantifiable method of computing the function strength based on the results of LDA. Moreover, based on the time-variant characteristics of trajectory data, an interactive visual analysis system called UFAVIS (urban functional areas visualization) is constructed to explore the impact of human activities on the spatial-temporal patterns of the functional areas. Using the method of functional area recognition with spatial-temporal feature analysis, experimental verifications and multiple case studies of the real data in Beijing are performed. The results demonstrate that UFAVIS can effectively identify the compositional functions of urban areas and find their spatial-temporal patterns changing with the variations of human activities, which provides guidance for urban planning and policy decision. © 2018, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

In this project, tweets relevant to Covid-19 Vaccine are extracted utilizing the Tweepy library. Next, tweet texts are converted into usable form in order to do sentiment analysis. After this, SentiWordNet lexicon is used to label the sentiment of the tweets. Stop words removal, Lemmatizing, stemming operations are also applied on the COVID-19 Vaccine tweets text data. Count Vectorizer and Tfidf Vectorizer are applied for mathematical conversion of the preprocessed text. Then, nine classification techniques namely - Multinomial-NB, Bernoulli-NB, Logistic-Regression, Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive-Classifier, Perceptron, Random Forest classifier, AdaBoostClassifier and Linear SVM are applied on the dataset obtained for sentiment classification and results are obtained in terms of accuracy. The best cross validation test score obtained is 0.785 with Logistic Regression Classifier and TfidfVectorizer.  © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While existing methods heavily rely on human-generated labels, it is prohibitively expensive to incorporate cross-domain experts for annotation in real-world scenarios. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new avenues for automating EA with annotations, inspired by their comprehensive capability to process semantic information. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply LLMs for EA since the annotation space in real-world KGs is large. LLMs could also generate noisy labels that may mislead the alignment. To this end, we propose a unified framework, LLM4EA, to effectively leverage LLMs for EA. Specifically, we design a novel active learning policy to significantly reduce the annotation space by prioritizing the most valuable entities based on the entire inter-KG and intra-KG structure. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised label refiner to continuously enhance label accuracy through in-depth probabilistic reasoning. We iteratively optimize the policy based on the feedback from a base EA model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of LLM4EA on four benchmark datasets in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. © 2024 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We observe that the process of extracting summarization of human can be divided into two stages: 1) a rough reading stage to look for sketched information, and 2) a subsequent careful reading stage to select key sentences to form the summary. By simulating such a two-stage process, we propose a novel approach for extractive summarization. We formulate the problem as a contextual-bandit problem and solve it with policy gradient. We adopt a convolutional neural network to encode gist of paragraphs for rough reading, and a decision making policy with an adapted termination mechanism for careful reading. Experiments on the CNN and DailyMail datasets show that our proposed method can provide high-quality summaries with varied length, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art extractive methods in terms of ROUGE metrics. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

If effectively processed, this underutilized data can provide critical insights to advance agricultural practices, decision-making, and sustainability. This work focuses on applying Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) to convert unstructured data into structured formats, addressing the challenges of domain-specific terminology and limited annotated datasets. This scarcity is primarily due to the domain-specific terminology, contextual complexity, and lack of annotated data in the agricultural domain. This study addresses these challenges by proposing sophisticated data augmentation techniques, validated using large language models and human reviewers, to enhance training data. We introduce AgNER-BERTa and AgRE-BERTa, two encoder-based models tailored for agricultural NER and RE tasks, and compare them with state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, including SciBERT, SpanBERT, and generative decoder models like ChatGPT. Our experiments demonstrate superior performance, achieving 98% accuracy for NER and 97% for RE outperforming SOTA models. The extracted entities and relations are used to construct the Agricultural Knowledge Graph (AgKG), providing structured, queryable insights to support precision agriculture, policy-making, and sustainable farming practices. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A comprehensive framework for disease management must fully connect the complete disease lifecycle, including emergence from reservoir populations, zoonotic vector transmission, and impact on human societies. The Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis is a software environment and conceptual architecture for data integration, situational awareness, visualization, prediction, and intervention assessment. Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis automatically collects biosurveillance data using natural language processing, integrates structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, applies advanced machine learning, and uses multi-modeling for analyzing disease dynamics and testing interventions in complex, heterogeneous populations. In the illustrative case studies, natural language processing from social media, news feeds, and websites was used for information extraction, biosurveillance, and situation awareness. Classification machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and boosting) were used for disease predictions. © The Author(s) 2017.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, there is a scarcity of comprehensive and up-to-date evidence to guide policymaking by monitoring climate innovation systems. This is notable, especially at the center of the innovation process, where nascent inventions transition into profitable and scalable market solutions. Here, we discuss the potential of large language models (LLMs) to monitor climate technology innovation. By analyzing large pools of unstructured text data sources, such as company reports and social media, LLMs can automate information retrieval processes and thereby improve existing monitoring in terms of cost-effectiveness, timeliness, and comprehensiveness. In this perspective, we show how LLMs can play a crucial role in informing innovation policy for the energy transition by highlighting promising use cases and prevailing challenges for research and policy. © 2023 The Author(s).

Sentiment analysis for social media content can help identify indicators of anxiety, such as negative language, stress expressions, or mental health struggles. This paper uses social media and surveys to develop a dataset for Pakistani graduate students. The dataset collects 5096 social media posts from 1170 users, categorising them into anxiety (46.7%), depression (12.6%), and motivation (40.7%) based on mental health levels. The survey responses are combined with the social media dataset. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF), are used to detect the mental health status of PhD scholars. The study finds that 59.3% of graduate students in Pakistan face anxiety and mental health issues, indicating a need for policy reformulation in graduate programmes. The research data is available online for further research (https://github.com/dr-m-wasim/PhD-Scholars-Mental-Health). © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Study Setting and Design: We analyzed data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health record (EHR) between October 2015 and December 2018 using the target trial emulation framework. Veterans were included in one or more trials if they were 18 years or older, had recent evidence of housing instability, had received care in VA for at least 1 year, and had never before enrolled in SSVF. Patients who enrolled in SSVF after meeting eligibility were assigned to the treatment group, while patients who did not enroll in SSVF were assigned to a control group. We extracted patients' housing outcomes from the EHR and modeled the probability of being unstably housed each day while accounting for confounders and irregular visit times. Data Sources and Analytic Sample: We extracted housing status and covariates from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Housing instability was ascertained using a combination of structured data elements and natural language processing. Principal Findings: We identified 238,059 unique patients who met the eligibility criteria for one or more trials. The risk of housing instability decreased in both arms over the three years after initiating a trial but was lower among SSVF enrollees, with a risk difference of −12.9% (95% confidence band −14.6%, −11.2%) on Day 120 and an attenuated difference of −2.4% (−4.0%, −0.7%) on Day 1095. Conclusions: SSVF is one of the largest rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention programs in the nation. We found that SSVF improves housing outcomes over the three years following enrollment, but the effect reduces over time. These findings can inform policy and program design for improving housing outcomes for homeless-experienced individuals. © 2025 The Author(s).

To study the automation process, we consider the hierarchical ABAC model as our reference model since it better reflects the requirements of real-world organizations. Therefore, this paper focuses on the questions of: how can we automatically infer the hierarchical structure of an ABAC model given NLACPs; and, how can we extract and define the set of authorization attributes based on the resulting structure. To address these questions, we propose an approach built upon recent advancements in natural language processing and machine learning techniques. For such a solution, the lack of appropriate data often poses a bottleneck. Therefore, we decouple the primary contributions of this work into: (1) developing a practical framework to extract authorization attributes of hierarchical ABAC system from natural language artifacts, and (2) generating a set of realistic synthetic natural language access control policies (NLACPs) to evaluate the proposed framework. Our experimental results are promising as we achieved - in average - an F1-score of 0.96 when extracting attributes values of subjects, and 0.91 when extracting the values of objects’ attributes from natural language access control policies. © 2019, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Downstream countries rely on the Mekong River for fisheries, agriculture, navigation and ecological services, while upstream countries have been constructing dams to generate hydropower. The dam construction and operation in upstream countries have changed the seasonality of streamflow in downstream countries, affecting their economic benefits. More recently, cooperation between upstream and downstream countries has been enhanced throughout the river basin. In this study, we introduce a quantitative socio-hydrological model to simulate hydrological processes, reservoir operations, economic benefits, policy feedbacks and therefore dynamics of cooperation within the Lancang-Mekong River basin. The model reproduces the observed dynamics of cooperation in the basin revealed by sentiment analysis of news articles. Hydrological variability such as droughts and human activities associated with reservoir operations affect dynamics of cooperation between the riparian countries, with importance attached to indirect political benefits of upstream playing an important role in the enhancement of cooperation. In this way, our study generated understanding of emergent cooperation dynamics in this transboundary river basin, and the socio-hydrological model used here provides a useful new framework to investigate and improve transboundary water management elsewhere.  © Author(s) 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since early May 2022, Mpox has been continuously reported in several endemic countries with alarming death rates. This led to several discussions and deliberations on the Mpox virus among the general public through social media and platforms such as health forums. This study proposes natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling to unearth the general public's perspectives and sentiments on growing Mpox cases worldwide. Study design: This was a detailed qualitative study using natural language processing on the user-generated comments from social media. Methods: A detailed analysis using topic modeling and sentiment analysis on Reddit comments (n = 289,073) that were posted between June 1 and August 5, 2022, was conducted. While the topic modeling was used to infer major themes related to the health emergency and user concerns, the sentiment analysis was conducted to see how the general public responded to different aspects of the outbreak. Results: The results revealed several interesting and useful themes, such as Mpox symptoms, Mpox transmission, international travel, government interventions, and homophobia from the user-generated contents. The results further confirm that there are many stigmas and fear of the unknown nature of the Mpox virus, which is prevalent in almost all topics and themes unearthed. Conclusions: Analyzing public discourse and sentiments toward health emergencies and disease outbreaks is highly important. The insights that could be leveraged from the user-generated comments from public forums such as social media may be important for community health intervention programs and infodemiology researchers. The findings from this study effectively analyzed the public perceptions that may enable quantifying the effectiveness of measures imposed by governmental administrations. The themes unearthed may also benefit health policy researchers and decision-makers to make informed and data-driven decisions. © 2023 The Royal Society for Public Health\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Traditional fare-setting methods often focus narrowly on financial objectives, neglecting broader impacts. This study introduces a novel collaborative game-theoretic model integrating user sentiment analysis to optimize fare policies. By incorporating utilities of passengers, operators, and governments, and employing the Shapley value for fair benefit distribution, this model aims to maximize social welfare. The methodology frames fare optimization as a cooperative game among stakeholders, integrating passenger preferences through sentiment analysis. The social welfare function combines the utilities of all stakeholders and is maximized under operational, environmental, and financial constraints. Implemented in Python and applied to Isparta, Turkey, the model identifies an optimal fare of 19.5 TL (ranged between 14 and 26.50 TL) that maximizes social welfare, aligning closely with existing fares. Shapley value analysis distributes the benefits, assigning 221,457 (35.6%) units to passengers, 54,562 (8.7%) units to operators, and 347,433 (55.7%) units to the government, highlighting significant environmental gains for the government. Sensitivity analyses confirm the model’s robustness across varying trip volumes, suggesting its applicability to diverse urban settings. This research contributes to socially equitable and user-centric fare policies by providing a comprehensive framework aligning stakeholder interests. Policymakers can leverage this model to design fare strategies promoting sustainability, efficiency, and collaboration in public transportation systems. © 2024 by the author.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We offer a technically informed, but at the same time accessible, analysis of the generative AI technology behind tools such as Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, to name the most prominent LLMs currently in use. Our aim in this essay is to go beyond prior work and to provide a more nuanced reflection on the possible application of such technology for the different activities and reasoning processes that constitute theorizing within our domain of scholarly inquiry. Specifically, we highlight ways in which LLMs might augment our theorizing, but we also point out the fundamental constraints in how contemporary LLMs ‘reason’, setting considerable limits to what such tools might produce as ‘conceptual’ or ‘theoretical’ outputs. Given worrisome trade-offs in their use, we urge authors to be careful and reflexive when they use LLMs to assist (parts of) their theorizing, and to transparently disclose this use in their manuscripts. We conclude the essay with a statement of Organization Theory’s editorial policy on the use of LLMs. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To further abstract requirements and propel automation in networking, several industries have proposed the paradigm of 'network intent'. However, the translation from intents to low-level policies is considered critical to program data planes and other network elements, especially when dealing with P4-enabled switches. In this paper, we present NLP4, an architecture that helps translate intents, in the form of human language, into data-plane programs, in the form of P4 rules. In particular, NLP4 uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to translate high-level human-language intents, a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model for processing the NLP output and converting it into mid-level policy. An API then uses this information, which separates the intent from the network to generate commands readable by P4-enabled switches. Our initial prototype on a network emulator validates our architecture for a specific case: load profiling, demonstrating how even users with limited P4 expertise may customize their networks by merely specifying intents.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of thromboembolic stroke in those at higher risk; but for a number of patients, stroke is the first manifestation of undetected AF. There is a rationale for the early diagnosis of AF, before the first complication occurs, but population-based screening is not recommended. Previous prediction models have been limited by their data sources and methodologies. An accurate model that uses existing routinely collected data is needed to inform clinicians of patient-level risk of AF, inform national screening policy and highlight predictors that may be amenable to primary prevention. Methods and analysis We will investigate the application of a range of deep learning techniques, including an adapted convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and Transformer, on routinely collected primary care data to create a personalised model predicting the risk of new-onset AF over a range of time periods. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD dataset will be used for derivation, and the CPRD-AURUM dataset will be used for external geographical validation. Both comprise a sizeable representative population and are linked at patient-level to secondary care databases. The performance of the deep learning models will be compared against classic machine learning and traditional statistical predictive modelling methods. We will only use risk factors accessible in primary care and endow the model with the ability to update risk prediction as it is presented with new data, to make the model more useful in clinical practice. Ethics and dissemination Permissions for CPRD-GOLD and CPRD-AURUM datasets were obtained from CPRD (ref no: 19_076). The CPRD ethical approval committee approved the study. The results will be submitted as a research paper for publication to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at peer-reviewed conferences. Trial registration details A systematic review to incorporate within the overall project was registered on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021245093).

This requirement is particularly relevant in the expanding field of E-government. In this paper, we present a preliminary analysis of a public database of Digital Governance projects, based on the combination of Complex Network models and Natural Language Processing techniques. We embed projects into a complex network, in which the strength of a connection binding two projects is determined by the semantic affinity between their titles. We use an unsupervised community detection algorithm to partition the network in sets of similar projects, and interpret the results to unveil hidden information in the database. Project ratings provided by an independent evaluation group are inspected in order to investigate the strategical value of the topics underlying the communities, laying the foundation for novel quantitative methods of policy design. © 2020 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The researchers used co-citation analysis and text mining afforded by VOSviewer to document and analyze research patterns and topics reported in peer-reviewed documents published between January 2020 and August 2021. Findings of this study indicated that scholars from 103 countries or regions from the Global North and Global South investigated a wide array of topics, such as use of various technologies and strategies, redesigned curriculum, student perceptions and psychological impacts of the pandemic-imposed online learning. Many researchers applied technology acceptance theories and structural equation modeling to investigate factors associated with adoption and impacts of the pandemic-imposed online learning. Of the large quantity of research, medical education and chemical education were the most investigated disciplines. Inquiry-based learning, discovery learning, hands-on learning and collaborative learning emerged as instructional approaches frequently discussed or utilized across the target studies. This paper discussed (a) ongoing and emerging challenges to online higher education, (b) placing innovative pedagogies at the forefront of online learning, and (c) rapid, but imbalanced distribution of evolving literature based on the findings. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Online learning had attracted growing traction as a flexible and affordable means to complement traditional higher education prior to COVID-19. Higher education institutions (HEIs), faculty and students around the globe have encountered various challenges and opportunities regarding online teaching and learning during COVID-19. What this paper adds A bird's-eye-view perspective of how HEIs around the globe responded to the pandemic-imposed online teaching and learning using the bibliometric methodology. Identifications of a large body of research (n = 1061 documents) conducted by scholars from 103 countries or regions that investigated the pandemic-imposed online higher education, indicating an unprecedented level of participation in this area. An analysis of distinct themes arising from research on the pandemic-imposed online learning, such as medical education and psychological impact, chemistry curriculum and laboratory-based instruction and technology acceptance model. Implications for practice and/or policy The large corpus of studies on online higher education from different aspects can provide cross-disciplinary information guiding future research and design of online learning. With technology often conceptualized as the solution to support online learning, it is imperative to put innovative pedagogy at the forefront of the design of online teaching and learning. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Earlier studies have attempted to study this problem using self-reported emotion measurements to identify the emotions the participants felt. As an alternative, we propose the use of an emotional artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for improved modeling and prediction of the participants’ emotional behaviour to guide decision-making. We have validated the system using emotional responses to a hypothetical CCS project as a case study. Running our simulation on the experimental dataset (thus 40% of the 72,105), we obtained an average validation accuracy of 98.81%. We challenged the algorithm further with 84 test samples (unseen cases), and it predicted 75 feelings correctly when the stakeholders took a definite position on how they felt. Although there are few limitations to this study, we did find, in a sensitivity experiment, that it was challenging for the algorithm to predict indecisive feelings. The method is adaptable to study emotional responses to other projects, including Wind Energy, Nuclear Energy and Hydrogen Technology. © 2019\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN, Chen et al. [2024]). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.

International agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement are the driving framework for developing policies and fostering research and innovation. However, the proportionality of technological innovation, funding, and policy development is very skewed towards energy-intensive sectors like transport, industry and energy and ignores sectors like agriculture and waste. This paper aims to explore three dimensions that drive the development of CCMT in the agriculture sector: innovation, policy and funding. We have used a mixed-method approach where we have collected open-source data, using text mining techniques for filtering CCMT and agriculture concerning regulations and projects, and applied a descriptive analysis. The findings of this study show that there is no precise alignment of the three dimensions and confirm that only 2.3% of the EU financial contribution goes to the agriculture sector. Moreover, most of the climate change policies or regulations are intended for energy-intensive sectors and not explicitly focused on agriculture. Finally, the analysis reveals that the constricted development of CCMT in the agricultural sector is not only due to the limited financial investment but also due to conflicting policies, decisions, and regulatory cooperation. © 2020 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention. Objective: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020. Results: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide. Conclusions: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment. Such approaches have implications for policy development to improve intervention accessibility in at-risk and underserved populations. © Anne Dwyer, Abílio de Almeida Neto, Dominique Estival, Weicong Li, Christa Lam-Cassettari, Mark Antoniou.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A CASE STUDY IN INDONESIA\n                    ABSTRACT: Purpose – This study was conducted to understand the potential of cashless subsidy to reduce illegal underground economy activity in Indonesia. Research methodology – The research was done through a qualitative approach then analyzed based on the content analysis and sentiment analysis using Digital Public Services Index frim Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) research methodology as base. The data used on this study are Indonesia e-news on kompas.com, detik.com, and tempo.co from March 2021-2022 using two keywords “subsidi” (subsidy), “non-tunai” (cashless) and “nirsentuh” (contactless). Findings – The result of this study shows illegal underground economy activity can be reduced by implementing cashless subsidy policy. Research limitations – The data used on the research were big data obtained from e-news because the lack primary reliable respondent. We could not estimate the cashless subsidy after COVID-19 was ended in Indonesia because the declaration of the end of COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia was on 29 June 2023. Practical implications – This study also provides two recommendations for those problems: (a) increase digital financial literacy awareness; (b) improve the formal economy activity. Originality/Value – There still no specific research of cashless subsidy and their practice in shadow economy perspective, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia. © 2025 The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using various natural language processing techniques, we identify the main topics discussed by the Fed and major audiences. While the Fed tweets talking about central banking topics attract greater attention from Twitter users, only the extensive margin is economically meaningful. Among all groups of users, the media accounts and economists are most active in engaging with the Fed, especially when discussing central banking-related issues. We also show that information extracted from the tweets can provide a real-time, qualitative diagnostic for inflation expectations and some reaction of these Twitter-based inflation expectations to policy action and communication. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Integrating research into policy formulation not only results in more effective policies but also allows researchers to extend the reach and influence of their work to a broader and more diverse audience. In this study, we focused on one of the protected and disadvantaged groups in society, youth, whose perspectives are frequently overlooked in research studies and policymaking, even though they comprise a significant portion of the US population. We built a model that can predict whether a research article will get more citations after the first citation or not using the textual features of the research articles. Experimenting with 11 classification algorithms and analyzing the results, we identified the most important textual features and the best model to drive researchers to generate research with a higher impact on policy. We found that avoiding using complex words in research articles increases the likelihood of getting more policy citations. Moreover, semantic relevance between the research article and the policy document does not inherently guarantee increased attention from policymakers.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the plans for offshore wind energy by the shore of the state still brings much controversy between residents due to the wind farms’ impact on wildlife, coastline, and the people’s view from the beaches. In this context, we perform sentiment analysis on social media data to investigate people’s opinions and concerns regarding offshore wind energy. We adapt 3 machine learning models, i.e. TextBlob, VADER and SentiWordNet for sentiment analysis because different functions are provided by each model, all of which are useful in our work. Techniques in NLP (natural language processing) are harnessed to gather meaning from the textual data in social media. Data visualization tools are suitably deployed to display the overall results. Despite the controversy surrounding this topic, our findings indicate some positive reception, suggesting potential support for modern-day renewable energy goals. However, there are neutral and negative comments as well, thus potentially helping to find areas for further improvement. The results of this work can be thus useful in a variety of decision-making contexts by governmental organizations and companies, hence aiding and enhancing offshore wind energy policy development. Hence, this work is much in line with citizen science and smart governance via involvement of mass opinion in decision support. In our paper, we highlight the role of sentiment analysis from social media in this aspect. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

By examining the discourse and frequency of terms connected to opioids, this study introduces a novel text mining tool to examine the role of the dark web in the opioid epidemic. Leveraging advanced data crawling techniques, this study encompasses the collection of a rich dataset from the dark web, revealing a predominance of discussions around opioids such as Oxycodone, Morphine, and Fentanyl. The results of our analysis show that Oxycodone is the most often referenced opioid, indicating that it is in high demand in the illegal drug trade. Furthermore, the surprising mention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) with opioids suggests a complicated terrain of self-medicating behaviors among users. This paper is notable for its methodological innovation, which uses text mining to provide insights into the dark web’s impact on the opioid crisis. The findings not only add to our comprehension of illicit opioid trade dynamics, but also provide vital information for public health policies and policy design targeted at reducing the opioid epidemic. Our study’s originality lies in its application of text mining to dark web data, a significant step forward in digital public health analytics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Dr. Shailesh R.

Nonetheless, the relationship between public health and populism extends before and beyond the pandemic. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of existing evidence and theoretical conceptualisations on the intersection of populism, health emergencies, and contrarian scientific positions, drawing from a diverse range of disciplines. I conducted a scoping review of 283 original studies, analysing their analytical framework, geographic focuses, and methodological approaches. Employing quantitative text analysis, I summarised the research field into 18 common topics, organised into five coherent categories: citizen's perspective, political elites, political communication, pandemic consequences, and non-COVID-related issues. While the scholarly interest in this area has surged since the onset of the pandemic, it has predominantly concentrated on specific cases, such as Brazil and the US, often conflating different policy types. The evidence summary elucidates that populism assumes varying roles within distinct contexts, and there is no linear relationship between political populism and specific approaches to health crises and science. I further compare definitions of populism within the context of health and scientific positions. I propose that future research should employ a policy typology for health emergency responses, assessing political positions based on policy arenas. This paper contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay between political populism, contrarian scientific perspectives, and public health. © 2024 The Author\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The role of social media is vital to this emerging trend. Traditionally, lack of public participation in various policy making decision used to be a major cause of concern particularly when formulating and evaluating such policies. However, the exponential rise in usage of social media platforms by general public has given the government a wider insight to overcome this long pending dilemma. Cloud-based e-governance is currently being realized due to IT infrastructure availability along with mindset changes of government advisors towards realizing the various policies in a best possible manner. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that combines the capabilities of both cloud computing and social media analytics towards efficient monitoring and controlling of governmental policies through public involvement. The proposed system has provided us some encouraging results, when tested for Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation by Indian government and established that it can be successfully implemented for efficient policy making and implementation. © 2019, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The aim of the present paper is to give an overview of research topics in early childhood education research based on the analysis of 39,926 scientific articles published between 2000 and 2021 and to explore research trends over time. Therefore, a structural topic modelling approach was used. The analyses show a strong increase in publication activity over the last years as well as the diversity of research topics, which provide important insights for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals in various areas (cultural diversity, design of inclusive learning environments, educational institutions, professional development issues, educational policy and reforms, etc.).

However, safety and security risks of SHs hinder their wide adoption. Many work attempts to provide defense mechanisms to ensure safety and security against interrule vulnerabilities and spoofing attacks. This article proposes IoTFuzz, a fuzzing framework that dynamically address cyber security and physical safety aspects of SHs through targeted policies. IoTFuzz mutates the inputs from policies, human activities, indoor environment, and real-life outdoor weather conditions. In addition to the binary status of devices, the continuous-value status in SHs is leveraged to perform mutation and simulation. The policies are expressed as temporal logic formulas with time constraints. For large-scale testing, IoTFuzz employs digital twins to simulate normal behaviors, outdoor environment impacts, and human activities in SHs. Moreover, IoTFuzz can also intelligently infer rule-policy correlation based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The evaluation of IoTFuzz in a configured SH with 15 rules and 10 predefined unique policies demonstrates its effectiveness in revealing the impacts of real-life outdoor environment. The experimental results demonstrate a range of violations, with a maximum of 4154 violations and a minimum of 41 violations observed over an 8-year period under varying weather conditions. IoTFuzz also identifies the potential risks associated with improper human activities, accounting for up to 35.4% of risky situations in SHs.  © 2014 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Anti-establishment rhetoric before and after government participation\n                    ABSTRACT: Scholars argued that anti-establishment parties use a populist rhetoric that appeals to the worst instincts of people. Indeed, populist politicians are often viewed as charismatic leaders that have fire in their belly. While in the past these parties heavily relied on anti-establishment platforms and communication rhetoric, their increasing electoral success along with the growing duties linked with government membership transform them into more established parties, rather than pure outsiders, and cast doubts on the feasibility of keeping a populist rhetoric. This paper compares right-wing and non-right-wing populism, investigating whether populist leaders change their rhetorical strategy once in office, decreasing the level of negativity and adopting a more forward-looking and inclusive style of communication, with a stronger focus on fulfilling the policy proposal made during the electoral campaign rather than blaming political rivals. For this purpose, we collected a new corpus of political speeches extracted from video messages posted on Facebook by four anti-establishment party leaders in three countries (Austria, Italy and Spain), from 2016 to 2018, i.e., immediately before and immediately after their access to power. Overall, 30 h of recorded audio from 215 videos (amounting to around 140 million visualizations) have been analyzed using topic models and well-established semantic psycholinguistic dictionaries. The results highlight slight changes in the rhetoric of populist leaders once in power, mostly for non-right-wing populists, as their language becomes less negative, less assertive and more focused on government duties. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Inspiring both fascination and fear, chatbots have stirred debates among researchers, developers, and policy makers. The concerns range from concrete and tangible ones—which include replication of existing biases and discrimination at scale, harvesting personal data, and spreading misinformation—to more existential fears that their development will lead to machines with human-like cognitive abilities. Understanding how chatbots work and the human labor and data involved can better help evaluate the validity of concerns surrounding these systems, which although innovative, are hardly the stuff of science fiction. © 2023 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Research Findings/Insights: We find a positive (negative) and statistically significant relationship between board size (board independence) and IPO underpricing at the time firms go public. But more importantly, when interacting with corporate governance variables at the firm level, uncertainty in tone still shows statistical significance, which suggests that tone in communications matters for underpricing independently of governance provisions at the firm level. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Bigger boards seem to lead to greater underpricing, whereas more independent boards mitigate it. This finding stresses the relevance of functional convergence in regions with weak institutions such as Latin America. Our results also suggest that tone matters for underpricing even in firms with good governance practices. We argue that tone in corporate communications is a strong signaling mechanism for market participants. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that tone in firms' communications is relevant for market valuation. In the context of family firms in an underresearched context such as Latin America, we show that reputation effect is priced by the market valuation of the IPO. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Yet little attention has been paid to the origins of regulatory discretion, and how it varies across polities, policy areas, and over time. This paper presents a conceptualization of regulatory discretion that draws on three dimensions: delegation, content, and procedure. It argues that to measure regulatory discretion in legislation, we need to identify provisions that delegate regulatory powers to governments and then examine the extent to which exercising regulatory powers is constrained. Using Natural Language Processing techniques, this paper presents descriptive findings of the dynamics of regulatory discretion in the United Kingdom between 1900 and 2020. The findings portray how discretion has been constrained and formalized over the years through the content of regulations, while it has still retained high levels of flexibility in exercising regulatory powers. In doing so, the findings illustrate the rise of the British regulatory state through its legislative language. © 2023 The Author.

Despite of police organizations being a rich source of qualitative data (present in less formally structured formats, such as the text logs), little work has been done in automating steps to allow this data to feed into intelligence-led policing tasks, such as demand analysis/prediction. This paper examines the use of police incident logs to better estimate the demand of officers across all incidents, with particular respect to the cases where mental-ill health played a primary part. Persons suffering from mental-ill health are significantly more likely to come into contact with the police, but statistics relating to how much actual police time is spent dealing with this type of incident are highly variable and often subjective. We present a novel deep learning based text mining approach, which allows accurate extraction of mental-ill health related incidents from police incident logs. The data gained from these automated analyses can enable both strategic and operational planning within police forces, allowing policy makers to develop long term strategies to tackle this issue, and to better plan for day-today demand on services. The proposed model has demonstrated the cross-validated classification accuracy of 89.5% on the real dataset. © 2019 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we develop and examine a research model hypothesising the underlying content-related factors contributing to the diffusion of misinformation. The study is tested by a dataset comprising 144K Twitter posts extracted from the United Kingdom from February 2020 to January 2022. We found that the frequency of three content topics (i.e., face protection, international economic support, and screening methods) is negatively associated with the diffusion of misinformation, whereas content similarity is not. Our analysis illustrates different influences of various trending topics on misinformation propagation in the setting of uncertainty management. Accordingly, policymakers, especially in times of crisis, should emphasize more information on preventive behaviours and provide factual messages that can improve public trust, reducing the possibility of misinformation spreading. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

One possible heuristic is to conceptualize discourse as a network of actors and policy beliefs. Here, we present an exemplary and widely applicable automated approach to extract discourse networks from large volumes of media data, as a bipartite graph of organizations and beliefs connected by stance edges. Our approach leverages various natural language processing techniques, alongside qualitative content analysis. We combine named entity recognition, named entity linking, supervised text classification informed by close reading, and a novel stance detection procedure based on large language models. We demonstrate our approach in an empirical application tracing urban sustainable transport discourse networks in the Swiss urban area of ZÜrich over 12 years, based on more than one million paragraphs extracted from slightly less than two million newspaper articles. We test the internal validity of our approach. Based on evaluations against manually automated data, we find support for what we call the window validity hypothesis of automated discourse network data gathering. The internal validity of automated discourse network data gathering increases if inferences are combined over sliding time windows. Our results show that when leveraging data redundancy and stance inertia through windowed aggregation, automated methods can recover basic structure and higher-level structurally descriptive metrics of discourse networks well. Our results also demonstrate the necessity of creating high-quality test sets and close reading and that efforts invested in automation should be carefully considered.  © The Author(s), 2025.

The case at hand, Germany, is a prime example of a welfare state that was particularly resistant to reform. Hence, the rapid paradigm shift in German family policy since the late 1990s is puzzling. This study seeks to resolve this puzzle by drawing on the insight that public discourse is crucial for policy change. Politicians have to promote reforms prior to their implementation. The main channel for communication with the wider public is the mass media. I use newspaper coverage from 1990 to 2016 to analyze whether the media is responsive to reform initiatives. I use topic modeling, an innovative method from the computational social sciences (CSS), to identify dominant themes and shifts over time in a large corpus of newspaper articles (N = 1,459). The analysis shows that public discourse was responsive to the parliamentary debate. The article also clarifies the role of critical events and identifies discursive strategies. © 2019 The Authors.

To capture this paradigm, this study surveyed telemedicine literature, including postpandemic publications, to identify dominant research themes and temporal trends and suggest directions for future research. Methods: A corpus of 56,445 telemedicine studies is sourced from PubMed. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling performed using the Konstanz Information Miner platform. The textual data for topic modeling were processed by following standard procedures for natural language processing. Moreover, the term frequency-inverse document frequency approach was used to capture the importance of words within the corpus. We assessed perplexity, coherence, and the elbow method to determine the optimal number of topics for modeling. Results: The findings confirm the surge in telemedicine research after 2020, signifying its prominence. LDA topic modeling reveals seven distinct research themes, with the most prominent topic being “patient satisfaction” (21.38%) followed by “perspectives and challenges” (17.95%), and “smartphone apps” (14.32%). Furthermore, the results demonstrate a noticeable shift in topics from screening to therapeutic applications of telemedicine. Conclusions: This study serves as a guide for a broad range of telemedicine research topics. This synthesis of themes reflects the commitment of scholars to address the changing dynamics and health care needs, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, aging in place, smartphone usage, and technological advancement. The analysis also reveals flexible research responses to policy and contextual shifts, highlighting the collective drive to broaden the application of telemedicine in community health care. © Aeri Kim et al., 2024; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Several studies showed that deep learning models using these architectures not only possess remarkable linguistic knowledge, but they also exhibit forms of factual knowledge, common sense, and even programming skills. However, the scientific community still debates about their reasoning capabilities, which have been recently tested in the context of automated AI planning; the literature presents mixed results, and the prevailing view is that current transformer-based models may not be adequate for planning. In this paper, we address this challenge differently. We introduce a GPT-based model customised for planning (PLANGPT) to learn a general policy for classical planning by training the model from scratch with a dataset of solved planning instances. Once PLANGPT has been trained for a domain, it can be used to generate a solution plan for an input problem instance in that domain. Our training procedure exploits automated planning knowledge to enhance the performance of the trained model. We build and evaluate our GPT model with several planning domains, and we compare its performance w.r.t. other recent deep learning techniques for generalised planning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Not only arriving at this policy, but theIndonesian government also implemented a follow-up policy, namely the obligation to show a vaccine certificate as a requirement for domestic travel. The policy came into effect and was implemented in 2021. The policy reaped pro and con opinions or responses from all Indonesian people. For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the sentiment of public opinion related to the implementation of the policy to achieve the goal of knowing the level of dominance of opinions and obtaining evaluation material for the Indonesian government regarding the implementation of the policy as well as the foundation material for the implementation of future policies. The collection of public opinion data was taken from digital news related to the topic COVID-19 vaccine certificates as a requirement for domestic travelsourced from Youtube with the acquisition of raw data, which was 1500. This sentiment analysis uses the Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm with steps, namely, data collection by scraping using Google Collab tools, text preprocessing, TF-IDF weighting, and Naïve Bayes classification in two ways, namely using Google Collab tools and using the system that has been built. The results of this study were that the accuracy values of the NBC algorithm were 73%, 75.7% (Google Colab), and 90.67% (System) with negative dominant public opinion sentiment value.  © 2024 Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The analysis is done in an empirical and quantitative way. The picture of certain topics in the news is measured by the sentiment in the media in the UK and Germany. This study measures the sentiment with the help of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural network that analyses sentiment in publicly available news streams in the UK and Germany. The results show that online media indeed transports different pictures for some popular topics and some neighboring countries in Europe if there is low media coverage. An equally interesting finding is that there is, in general, a broad consensus between the sentiments in British and German media if media coverage is high. In addition to the differences in media reporting between the UK and Germany, this study shows that low media coverage also tends to reflect badly on the business indicators of a target variable/topic. Both findings show that low media coverage tends to transport inaccurate information. These findings show again how important the fake news and post-truth debate is. Social media users in a filter bubble are not only confronted with filtered and biased news. In addition, news coverage in general narrows and the filter bubble problems get amplified. Businesses, news providers, social media networks, political actors, and policymakers can consider the information provided to analyze the source of information gaps and the impact on their operations and policies. © The Authors, 2019.

Social media posts convey not only plain text, but also sentiments and emotions that provide insight into the experiences of the autism community. While sentiment analysis categorizes overall sentiment, emotion analysis provides nuanced insights into specific emotional states. The objective of this study is to identify emotions in posts related to autism and compare the emotions specifically contained in posts that include the hashtag #ActuallyAutistic with those that do not. Methods: We extracted a sample of X' posts related to autism and used DistilBERT to assign one out of six emotions (sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, surprise) to each post. Results: We have analyzed a total of 414,287 posts, 98,602 (23.8%) of those included the hashtag #ActuallyAutistic. The most common expressed emotion was joy, which was expressed in 52.5% of the posts, followed by sadness, identified in 28.6% of the posts. 12% of the posts expressed fear, 4.9% reflected anger, 1.1% showed love, and 0.9% expressed surprise. Posts tagged as #ActuallyAutistic showed less joy (27.1% vs. 60.4% in posts without this hashtag, p<0.001) and more sadness (52.7% vs. 21.1% in those without the hashtag, p<0.001). Conclusions: The use of the hashtag #ActuallyAutistic is associated with a different emotional tone, characterized by less joy and more sadness. These results suggest the need for greater support and acceptance towards the autistic community, both online and in society in general. Insights from our study can be valuable for policy makers, health, educational or other programmes aiming at enhancing well-being, inclusiveness, improve services, and create a more compassionate and understanding atmosphere for autistic people. © 2024 The Authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An immersive learning experience, in which learners participate in simulated virtual environments, can promote deep learning as learners actively explore and construct knowledge within the learning environments. Despite the growing interest and increasing applications, the ways in which machine learning can be used to augment the design and assessment of immersive learning experience remain an open area of exploration. Machine learning can be used to provide adaptive and personal-ized learning, increase interactivity and engagement, and track learning activities in immersive learning environments. In this chapter, the author describes the current state of research on machine learning in immersive learning environments, including adaptive and personalized learning, natural language processing and conversational artificial intelligence, and data and learning analytics. The author also outlines the potential future directions for the applications of machine learning in designing and assessing immersive learning experiences to inform educational sciences. This chapter serves as a useful reference for educational researchers, practitioners, and policy makers seeking to make informed decisions on the design and assessment of immersive learning experiences. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The object to be assembled is of industrial nature: for the application, it consists in a car engine oil pump. The following devices are used to the realization of the assembly: - A commercially available robot (ERICC with 5 d.o.f rotation and filled with DC actuators); it is relatively inexpensive, with medium-rating performance (0,5 mm of repeatability); - An image processing system, including a CCD 580x500 pixels video camera plus an image processor board for the acquisition and processing of the images; GO-NO-GO tactil sensors implemented on the robot as well as in the assembly area, intended to monitor the operations; Two conveyor belts carrying parts to be assembled; -Three PC-AT like microcomputers for the control of these equipments; - One commercially available expert system (NEXPERT OBJECT) with which the user has to build the knowledge base. Thanks to the realization and integration of the following: - Learning softwares for the creation of a whole set of data necessary during the assembly process: robot trajectories, objects models; - One image processing module based on fast image segmentation and description algorithms, allowing the recognition of the objects; - One control and monitoring module which will build and execute a sequence of ordered actions from a general manufacturing plan, to provide the final product. The implemented module is a Production Rule System, whose knowledge base contains the list of actions to be carried out, depending on the state of the assembly cell. If the sensors detect a random behaviour, a set of specific rules is activated in order to generate, if possible, a new action sequence to allow the manucfacturing process to continue) - An assembly platform which makes use of passive compliance. Among the advantages of this technique based on medium accuracy robot/specific image processing system/passive compliance assembly platform/expert system: - The investment is sufficient to carry out the industrial assembly of medium size units (measured in cm) with clearances of tenths of a millimetter; - Staff training: the firm's toolist specialists can build the assembly platform in just a few weeks. Since the image learning software and creation trajectory software have an user friendly man-machine interface only a few days are required to master theirs operations. Since the knowledge expression is performed in a syntax close to the natural language, someone who has smattering of artificial intelligence will be able to build the knowledge base; - The flexibility of the unit, thanks to the expert system and the image processing system; - The assembly speed should be considered within the firm's automation policy.

This paper argues that we must expand this view and consider generative AI not merely as a vehicle for producing traditional content at scale, but as enabling an entirely new form of media that is adaptive and interactive in real-time and can be personalized for individual users. Referred to herein as Interactive Generative Media (IGM), this new form of targeted influence could be used to manipulate individual users at scale and compromise human agency. Two specific tactics are presented: Targeted Generative Advertising and Targeted Conversational Influence. The risks of each are described along with recommended policy protections. © 2023 IMSCI.

Methods: All municipal governments in Japan in existence as of October 1, 2008 (n = 1,809) were sent a self-administrated postal questionnaire; 1,027 (56.8%) responded. Answers to the open-ended question were analysed using IBM SPSS Text Analytics for Surveys 4.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: Only about one-quarter of 1,027 municipalities (n - 242; 23.6%) offered support measures to provide or arrange opportunities for older residents with dementia to enhance various motivating factors in their lives. The most common measure was adult day services, which were not for providing formal care services covered by Japan's Long Term Care (LTC) insurance but for offering social and leisure activities (n = 95; 39.3%). Conclusion: None of the support measures found in this study were distinctive or exclusively for older people with dementia, but were rather common services for older people implemented widely in Japan. Further studies are required to find out the causes of differences in basic policy regarding social inclusion of older people with dementia among municipal governments in Japan. © 2014 Japan Health Sciences University & Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Methods: Analyzing 105,727 posts from Naver news comments, blogs, internet cafés, and Twitter between 2010 and 2022, this study deployed a Python script for data collection and preprocessing. STM analysis was con-ducted using R, with the documents’ publication years serving as metadata to trace the evolution of discussions on patient safety. Re-sults: The analysis identified a total of 13 distinct topics, organized into three primary communities: (1) “Demand for systemic improvement of medical accidents,” underscoring the need for legal and regulatory reform to enhance accountability; (2) “Efforts of the government and organizations for safety management,” highlighting proactive risk mitigation strategies; and (3) “Medical accidents exposed in the media,” reflecting widespread concerns over medical negligence and its repercussions. These findings indicate pervasive concerns regarding medical accountability and transparency among healthcare consumers. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of transparent healthcare policies and practices that openly address patient safety incidents. There is clear advocacy for policy reforms aimed at increasing the accountability and transparency of healthcare providers. Moreover, this study highlights the significance of edu-cational and engagement initiatives involving healthcare consumers in fostering a culture of patient safety.

However, manually collecting policy-related evidence is a time-consuming and tedious process, making some automated collection methods necessary. This paper presents a novel approach for automating policy evidence collection through large language models (LLMs) combined with Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) prompting. The advantages of our approach lie in its minimal data requirements, while ReAct prompting enables the LLM to call external tools, such as search engines, ensuring real-time evidence collection. Since this is a novel problem without existing methods for comparison, we relied on human experts for ground truth and baseline comparison. In 50 experiments, our method successfully collected correct policy evidence 36 times using GPT-3.5. Furthermore, with more advanced models such as GPT-4o, the improved understanding of prompts and context enhances our method’s efficiency. Finally, our method using GPT-4o successfully gathered correct evidence 45 times in 50 experiments. Our results demonstrate that, using our method, policy researchers can effectively gather evidence to support policy-making. © 2025 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this complex context, new agricultural policies are being implemented in Europe. Their success depends on their potential to adapt to new realities, responding to the opinions and demands of the European population. Given the rapid rise of social media as an important part of people's daily lives, public administrations have introduced digitalization and communication strategies through social media sites. Social media can provide policymakers with large amounts of data on user opinions. Given the value of social media as a rich source of data on public views and opinions, the aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to use natural language processing (NLP) to identify the events that have led to negative or positive opinion about European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform and (ii) to evaluate the ability of NLP to study users' opinions on Twitter/X. The findings show that issues such as Brexit, the European Green Deal, the role of CAP in the environment, livestock farming, food safety, and illegal practices and corruption in the distribution of CAP funds have crucial implications for the design and application of the new CAP. Moreover, the study also suggests that NLP techniques can provide opportunities to integrate agricultural policies and instruments in the agri-food sector by assessing society's opinions. Sentiment analysis, even considering its limitations, could support sound and inclusive policymaking approaches anticipating public opinion in cases of risk of social unrest. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Most current methods employ the encoder–decoder framework to achieve satisfactory results. Recently, transformers have been extensively utilized in image captioning tasks and earned satisfactory results. Nevertheless, transformers pay more attention to the global features in images and divide images into fixed sizes and process them separately. Those models can not capture the relationship between the internal components in image, such as the relationships between objects, regions and object attributes. In this article, we introduce a novel Residual Swin Transformer and Actor-Critic (RSTAC) in the image captioning task. RSTAC consists of two modules: Residual Swin Transformer and Actor-Critic modules. In particular, we employ a residual network to preserve the vanilla feature in the first place and several residual Swin Transformer blocks with convolution operations to obtain the mid-level features, which are also composed of a residual network and several Swin Transformer blocks and convolution operations. It aims to explore the internal correlation between image content and obtain multi-view features in the image. Then, a policy network is utilized to explore possible words and forecast the future generation word. A value network is employed to calculate the reward of generated sentences whose goal is directly optimizing non-differentiable quality metrics and enhancing the performance of generated sentences. Experiments reveal that our model surpasses other competitive models and performs better on the MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2022.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study presents a deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) clustering algorithm integrated with a multinomial logit model to extract and analyze individual activity-trip patterns from the 2017–2018 Regional Travel Survey (RTS) data from the Washington metropolitan area. Transforming daily activities of travelers into 288 five-minute intervals, the data was prepared as text and then fed into the NLP model, combined with a k-means clustering algorithm. This method identifies six distinct acitivity pattern clusters, encompassing full-time and part-time workers, retirees, students, and self-employed individuals. The model succeeds in recognizing distinct activity pattern clusters that were then interpreted looking at the relationships between activities, patterns, and socio-economic characteristics. It leverages the multinomial logit model to analyze the probability of cluster membership based on socio-economic factors, enriching the understanding of activity patterns across different demographic groups. This approach offers a nuanced perspective on urban populations' travel behaviors, facilitating targeted and equitable urban planning and policy-making. The study demonstrates the model's capability in handling complex activity sequence datasets, consisting of temporal activity sequences. This research underscores the value of integrating deep learning models in urban studies, opening new avenues for sophisticated, data-driven urban planning. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The evaluation time of a PDP (Policy Decision Point) grows significantly when the PDP loads a large-scale policy set coded in XACML. In order to improve the PDP evaluation performance, we propose an optimized policy evaluation engine, namely XDLEngine, and make the following contributions. First, XDLEngine has an advantage in the process of handling a large-scale policy set, and innovatively adopts the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model to cluster policies. Second, according to the clustering results of the LDA model, we digitize and vectorize all rules in policy sets, which facilitates the rule matching. Third, the cosine similarity is introduced to classify the rules under each topic, which greatly reduces the number of comparisons in the process of rule matching and improves the matching efficiency of XDLEngine. Finally, due to the independence between different topics, we use a multi-threaded parallel search in the process of rule matching, which significantly lowers the evaluation time of XDLEngine. The experimental results show that when the number of requests reaches 20,000, the evaluation time of XDLEngine for a practical large-scale policy set with 120,000 rules is approximately 2.48%, 3.47% and 3.68% of that of the Sun PDP, XEngine and HPEngine, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Most LLM deployments occur within cloud data centers, where they encounter substantial response delays and incur high costs, thereby impacting the Quality of Services (QoS) at the network edge. Leveraging vector database caching to store LLM request results at the edge can substantially mitigate response delays and cost associated with similar requests, which has been overlooked by previous research. Addressing these gaps, this paper introduces a novel Vector database-assisted cloud-Edge collaborative LLM QoS Optimization (VELO) framework. Firstly, we propose the VELO framework, which ingeniously employs vector database to cache the results of some LLM requests at the edge to reduce the response time of subsequent similar requests. Diverging from direct optimization of the LLM, our VELO framework does not necessitate altering the internal structure of LLM and is broadly applicable to diverse LLMs. Subsequently, building upon the VELO framework, we formulate the QoS optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and devise an algorithm grounded in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to decide whether to request the LLM in the cloud or directly return the results from the vector database at the edge. Moreover, to enhance request feature extraction and expedite training, we refine the policy network of MARL and integrate expert demonstrations. Finally, we implement the proposed algorithm within a real edge system. Experimental findings confirm that our VELO framework substantially enhances user satisfaction by concurrently diminishing delay and resource consumption for edge users utilizing LLMs.  © 2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, they are still suffering from low accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose to strengthen the existing approach by enhancing a language agent, which provides automatic explanation of terms and repair of tactics parameters. Term explanation explains terms specific to the proof obligations formally and tactic parameter repair complements the potentially correct proof tactics as much as possible. Similar to the existing approach, the agent uses GPT-4 as query objects in a search policy. During the search, we add term explanation to the prompt, and then the policy selects a proof tactic and repairs it. The repaired tactics interact with the theorem prover (Coq), and the execution result is fed back to build the prompt for the next policy invocation. We evaluate our approach on subsets of the CompCert project implemented using Coq. Our approach proves 8.11% more theorems than the existing language agent COPRA, and demonstrates faster search and proof speed. Besides, when term explanation and tactic parameter repair are applied, the performance of the SOTA method PROVERBOT9001 can be also improved. © 2024 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, I analyze Wealth of Nations and A Theory of Moral Sentiments-analysis which refutes environmentalists' claims that Smith's self-interest is the motivating factor of capitalist accumulation in our economy. In order for a change in ethics and broader policy that may encourage sustainable land practices within our present economic and agricultural system, I hypothesize that we must also include Aldo Leopold's land ethic to strengthen the claim that Smith's notion of sympathy can be stretched to change the way humans interact with and perceive nature. Using the works and critique of Smith and Leopold as foundations, this paper re-theorizes the present day ethical human. Amidst a tumultuous landscape, I argue a change in ethics is required to institute on a large scale, sustainable practices that can mitigate environmental degradation and put us in harmony with fellow humans and nature. To ground my research, I also rework Carol Rose's customary claims as a possible legal mechanism to work with the new ethical human. Lastly, I contribute particular strategies for current social movements, so they may recognize the new ethical self in others and other things, not as divided from the land, but part of it. © Common Ground Publishing, Charles S.

The conference was supported by generous funding from the University of Toronto Press and from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The contributions to this special issue of the UTLJ are based on articles originally presented at the conference. Some of the speakers discussed the kinds of tasks that machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) can perform, when used to conduct legal research, to identify biases and discrepancies at the doctrinal level and in the performance of lawyers and judges, and to facilitate access to justice for those who cannot readily afford legal services. Other speakers considered the challenges that algorithms based on ML and NLP pose to democratic conceptions of legal authority. Taken together, the articles offered a range of views on the prospects and perils of AI for the practice of law and for the legal system as a whole. This introduction briefly describes the contributions, moving roughly from the more theoretical to the more concrete aspects of these issues. © 2018 University Of Toronto Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Though it is well recognized that emergence of new fields is complex and uncertain, to make decisions amidst such uncertainty, one needs to mobilize various sources of intelligence to identify known–knowns and known–unknowns to be able to choose appropriate strategies and policies. This competitive technical intelligence cannot rely on simple trend analyses because breakthrough technologies have little past to inform such trends, and positing the directions of evolution is challenging. Neither do qualitative tools, embracing the complexities, provide all the solutions, since transparent and repeatable techniques need to be employed to create best practices and evaluate the intelligence that comes from such exercises. In this paper, we present a hybrid roadmapping technique that draws on a number of approaches and integrates them into a multi-level approach (individual activities, industry evolutions and broader global changes) that can be applied to breakthrough technologies. We describe this approach in deeper detail through a case study on dye-sensitized solar cells. Our contribution to this special issue is to showcase the technique as part of a family of approaches that are emerging around the world to inform strategy and policy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study introduces an AI-driven framework combining BERTopic, semantic similarity analysis, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to evaluate alignment between 106,661 English-language academic papers and 618 national-level policy documents. Topic modeling reveals strong convergence in themes such as “Coal mining and geological formations,” which account for 15.73 % of academic publications, while “Safety regulations and worker protection” dominate policy texts at 13.35 %. In contrast, emerging topics like “Digital economy and carbon transformation” remain underrepresented, with a popularity score of only 0.13. Semantic similarity analysis across 22 policy and 27 academic topics yields an average cosine similarity of 0.23, with only 12.5 % of topic pairs exceeding 0.4, underscoring thematic misalignment. Structurally, policy networks are 15.9 times denser and exhibit 30 × higher clustering coefficients than scientific networks, indicating more centralized but less diversified discourse. DRL-based prioritization identifies “Power systems and renewable integration” as the top-performing theme (Q-value = 1.6225), highlighting opportunities for targeted energy transition policies. These quantitative results offer empirical evidence to guide theme-based policy adaptation and foster actionable science-policy integration. © 2025 The Author\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using emotion analysis on data gathered from a social media platform, experiments are developed to bring new value to architectural and civic narratives. Emotions from texts collected within social media platforms are extracted and mapped alongside tagged locations to gain a greater understanding of how public spaces are utilized. This project develops a new analytical layer within our built environment, working alongside the urban fabric, mechanical systems, and digital infrastructure. It is offered as an interactive tool for policymakers and designers to glean feedback, creating an informed conversation between citizens and decision-makers. Whereas social media platforms such as Twitter and Yelp have been referenced in past academic contexts, this project moves further by producing quantified emotions, painting a differentiated result from what purely semantic data could deliver. © 2020, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

While debates rage among policymakers, practitioners, and politicians about regulating AI's widespread use, it's undeniable that AI represents a long-awaited digital technology poised to revolutionize organizational performance. Amidst the post-COVID era, the allure of AI has intensified, yet the critical question lingers: Can firms effectively harness AI and other technologies, such as Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), to enhance their existing systems? Through a systematic literature review, a clear correlation between firms’ implementation of AI, including the cutting-edge Generative AI, and their ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, drive operational excellence, and unlock new avenues for growth are explored. Moreover, key drivers of AI and digital adoption, such as the imperative for data-driven decision-making, the quest for customer-centricity, and the drive for sustainable business practices are explored. Our research not only highlights the transformative potential of AI and digital technologies but also provides actionable insights for business leaders navigating the complexities of technology adoption. By understanding the motivations, challenges, and strategic imperatives driving firms' technology choices, including the integration of Generative AI and LLMs, organizations can chart a path towards sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the digital age. This study underscores the revolutionary impact of Generative AI in digital transformation, offering a comprehensive understanding of their role in shaping the future of business. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Policymakers have a need to understand the dynamics of public discussion in real time. Human values, which are cognitively related to attitudes and serve as reference points in moral argument, are important indicators of what's at stake in a public controversy. This work shows that it is possible to link values data with reader behavior to infer values implicit in a topical corpus, and that it is possible to automate this process using machine learning. Thus, this work represents a preliminary attempt at scalable computational social science using techniques from natural language processing. © 2011 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A Big Data Analytics Study of China\n                    ABSTRACT: The transition from combustion vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is critical for mitigating climate change. As the global leader in the EV market, China has been propelled by government policies, market dynamics, and public awareness. As sentiment is fundamental to human communication, however, existing research lacks a systematic examination of the extent to which public environmental affect influences EV adoption at the macro level, particularly in the presence of government interventions and market strategies. To address this gap, we construct a novel affect index using a CNN deep learning model to extract environmental affect (positive, negative, and neutral) from Weibo posts between 2014 and 2023. Employing monthly EV market share as the dependent variable, we incorporate affect indices as key independent variables, alongside control variables such as government subsidy reductions, price levels, and other marketing strategies. A time-series cointegration model is applied to assess the long-term impact of environmental affect on EV sales. Empirical results reveal that only positive environmental affect has a significant and positive impact on EV adoption, whereas key industry factors, including subsidies, charger availability, patent activity, and price disparities, also play crucial roles. These findings highlight the growing influence of public awareness in shaping the EV market transition from government-driven to market-driven growth. Our study reconciles conflicting findings in prior research and provides actionable insights for policymakers and marketers seeking to foster sustainable EV adoption. © 2025 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Based on trends in the growth of LLMs/data centers and symmetry/favorability of SMR techno-regulatory environments, scenario analysis yielded nine potential future scenarios. This analysis finds three sets of insights: First, SMRs offer the most promise in the “Era of Radical Innovation” scenario, where they could emerge as a key clean power supply for data centers via distributed generation systems. Second, three key factors will determine the success of SMR implementation: optimizing regulatory framework, achieving technological maturity and enhancing social acceptance. Third, adverse SMR scenario triggers the need for alternative strategies, such as renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency enhancement. It pinpointed major challenges to address: decoupling licensing processes, gaining economic competitiveness via modular fabrication and stakeholder acceptance. Against this background, the study offers a three-tiered set of policy recommendations: one for immediate action (including regulatory reforms and R&D support); another focused on medium-term infrastructure development and workforce training; and a third targeted on long-term international cooperation frameworks. A systematic evaluation of their potential to meet the rising power demands for AI while providing energy security and environmental sustainability is presented in this research. © 2024 Korean Nuclear Society\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, implementing such reports entails a challenge, such as the comprehension of a large number of textual information from various sources. This task can be accelerated by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and ontologies to effectively model the domain knowledge. In this study, we extended an existing ontology to model ESRS Topical Standard for disclosure. The developed ontology would enable automated reasoning over the data and assist in constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Moreover, the proposed ontology extension would also help to identify gaps in companies’ sustainability reports with regard to the ESRS requirements. Additionally, we extracted knowledge from corporate sustainability reports via LLMs guided with a proposed ontology and developed their KG representation. ©2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Due to population growth and high urbanization rates, cities must enhance the quality and efficiency of services and resources provided, while at the same time supporting sustainable and long-term economic growth. However, few cities worldwide are actually becoming truly “smart,” most of them being in the early stages of implementation. This chapter aims to provide how artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning natural language processing and robotics can serve to overcome the main smart cities challenges (budgetary constraints, one-size-fits-all approach, digital skills and curriculum reforms, security and privacy problems, pollution, traffic congestion, citizens’ inclusion, governance, and regulatory framework represent important challenges facing smart cities development). © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

NLM's director, Donald A.B. Lindberg M.D., and staff sought to identify new program possibilities benefitting from the input of current and potential users of the Library's information services. Conference recommendations led to a key NLM policy change providing cost-free access to all AIDS data, and the establishment of the HIV/AIDS Community Information Outreach Program (ACIOP), which enabled new partnerships with local community-based organizations serving the affected community. Uniquely funded and long running, more than 300 ACIOP projects have been supported to-date. These projects have improved awareness and use of national HIV/AIDS information resources; enhanced information seeking skills; developed locally generated information resources; and enhanced the capacity of community-based organizations to use new information and computer technologies providing access to essential information resources and services.  © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, existing systems engage with users in a reactive manner, relying on a basic single-query mechanism with the knowledge base and employing passive policy planning. The proactive TOD systems, which can provide potentially helpful information and plan cross-domain multi-task dialogue policies, have not been well studied. In addition, effective evaluation methods are also lacking. To address these issues, we propose ProTOD, a novel LLM-based proactive TOD framework designed to improve system proactivity and goal completion. First, we design an adaptive exploratory retrieval mechanism to dynamically navigate domain knowledge. Second, we introduce a two-stage passive-to-proactive policy planner that effectively organizes knowledge and actions relationship. Finally, we develop two distinct user simulators with different personalities to simulate real-world interactions and propose a new error measure called Human-targeted Policy Edit Rate (HPER) for evaluation. Experimental results show that ProTOD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, improving goal completion rates by 10% while significantly enhancing the proactive engagement. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This logic gained a stronghold in policymaking, but its implementation nevertheless struggled to find acceptance. Public university tuition is one such case where policymakers aimed to increase investment in human capital through cost sharing. While students in some countries accept them as a necessary evil, opposition arises in others. Students in Germany and Turkey took to the streets in support of tuition-free higher education. Despite differences in their political contexts and the differential mediating role political culture plays, student mobilization reversed right-wing parties’ policies. This article focuses on how opposition to tuition policies is covered by the news in both countries. Using a mixed-methods approach combining topic modeling with qualitative analysis, I show that student protests and tuition policy discussions are reported separately. In both countries, student protests involving confrontation were highlighted whereas reports on institutional actors dominated policy discussions. However, when movements pressure political parties to “own” an issue in their platform, party endorsement subsequently amplifies issue salience even if movement organizations and parties are not covered together by the media. This indicates an indirect effect of movements’ collective action on news coverage. Political party endorsements mediate the amount of coverage movement issues receive. This finding provides insights into how opposition to welfare state retrenchment might navigate difficulties in closed media cultures that heavily favor institutional actors. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study provides a descriptive account of uncivil interactions between citizens and politicians on Twitter. We develop a conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of incivility at three distinct levels: macro (temporal), meso (contextual), and micro (individual). Using longitudinal data from the Twitter communication mentioning Members of Congress in the United States across a time span of over a year and relying on supervised machine learning methods and topic models, we offer new insights about the prevalence and dynamics of incivility toward legislators. We find that uncivil tweets represent consistently around 18% of all tweets mentioning legislators, but with spikes that correspond to controversial policy debates and political events. Although we find evidence of coordinated attacks, our analysis reveals that the use of uncivil language is common to a large number of users. © The Author(s) 2020.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Patent citation analysis is easy to use, but fundamentally has two main limitations: (1) new patents tend to be less cited than old ones and may miss citations to contemporary patents; (2) citation-based analysis cannot be used for patents in databases which do not require citations. Naturally, citation-based analysis tends to underestimate the importance of new patents and may not work in rapidly-evolving industries in which technology life-cycles are shortening and new inventions are increasingly patented world-wide. As a remedy, this paper proposes a patent network based on semantic patent analysis using subject-action-object (SAO) structures. SAO structures represent the explicit relationships among components used in a patent, and are considered to represent key concepts of the patent or the expertise of the inventor. Based on the internal similarities between patents, the patent network provides the up-to-date status of a given technology. Furthermore, this paper suggests new indices to identify the technological importance of patents, the characteristics of patent clusters, and the technological capabilities of competitors. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to synthesis of carbon nanotubes. We expect that the proposed procedure and analysis will be incorporated into technology planning processes to assist experts such as researchers and R&D policy makers in rapidly-evolving industries. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Reviews of this policy domain mostly either refer to general issues without deep immersion into details or focus on specific narrower aspects. The paper uses semantic analysis to identify major themes of science, technology and innovation policies over the last three decades and to trace their evolution towards current policy setting. We use semantic tools for processing and analysing documents produced by one of the major and highly reputable international expert bodies, the OECD Working Party on Technology and Innovation Policy. We show that selected themes remain in the mainstream even though being affected by regular policy adjustments and refinements and which disappear or appear with new challenges and expected solutions. Other themes appear niche or exotic themes which are under discussion for some time only. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to ascertain the inclination and the reasons for vaccine hesitancy by conducting content analysis and sentiment analysis of the perspectives expressed in comments on videos related to vaccine hesitancy uploaded from India on YouTube. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment of the sentiments of the vaccine-hesitant population is done using Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis module implemented with Python’s NLTK library to automatically determine the sentiments of the comments. Manual content analysis was performed on 60.09% viewer comments randomly selected from the total comments in 238 videos on vaccine hesitancy originated from India and labelled each comment with labels “Anti”, “Pro”, “Confused”, “Not Applicable” and “Unrelated” labels. Findings: The study found “Mistrust-Government policies”, “Fear-health related consequences”, “Mistrust-Scientific research”, “Vaccine effectiveness and efficacy” and “Misinformation/myths” as the top five determinants for vaccine hesitancy, whereas “Religious beliefs”, “Fear-Economic consequences”, “Side Effects- short-term” and “Fear-mode of administration” found to be the lesser cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. However, the study also investigates changes in the inclination of Indian commenters towards vaccine hesitancy and revolving issues over time. Social implications: Public health policymakers and health communicators may find the study useful in determining vaccine hesitancy factors in India. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its approach. To date, no sentiment analysis has been conducted on the content released on YouTube by Indian content creators regarding pro- and anti-vaccination videos. This inquiry seeks to fill this research gap. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Traditionally, incorporating information into EBP is time-consuming and dependent on human expertise. However, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies presents an opportunity to revolutionise the collection, analysis, and utilisation of evidence in policymaking. Despite the rapid advancements in AI algorithms, their roles and functions in EBP, particularly in science and technology (S&T), have not been systematically explored. This research aims to examine the functions of AI in S&T EBP, employing an interdisciplinary approach and a non-normative perspective. The study is conducted in two phases. The first phase utilises a comprehensive literature review to identify and conceptualise the components of AI-enabled EBP, including the technological aspects of AI and its policy functions. In the second phase, the constant comparative method (CCM) is employed to categorise and establish relationships between the identified components. This research identifies seven main AI technologies including natural language processing, speech recognition, image recognition and processing, affect detection, autonomous agents, data mining, and artificial creativity, which have 30 policy functions. The proposed framework of this research shows the relationships among AI-enabled EBP steps, AI technologies, and their policy functions. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The benefits of computerised text analysis come from the ability to analyse, for the first time, complex and daunting electronic sources of text, such as the parliamentary record. This allows the systematic estimation of the policy positions of individual political actors, with huge benefits both for theory development and empirical analysis. In this article, the technique is used to analyse all 58 English language speeches made in the October 1991 confidence debate on the future of the incumbent Fianna Fáil-PD coalition. The task was to use the words spoken in the debate to locate every one of the individual speakers on a 'pro- versus anti-government' dimension. The purpose was, first, to examine the validity of computerised text analysis when applied to legislative speeches and, second, to answer substantively interesting questions about the positions of individual Irish legislators in 1991. The results vindicate the use of computerised analysis in the context of legislative speeches and locate all speakers in the 1991 debate in a substantively interesting policy space. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This was a stark contrast to the steep falls in most types of recorded crime. Why was ASB so different? Was it changes in ‘traditional’ ASB such as noisy neighbours, or was it ASB records of breaches of COVID-19 regulations? Further, why did police-recorded ASB find much larger early-pandemic increases than the Telephone Crime Survey for England and Wales? This study uses two approaches to address the issues. The first is a survey of police forces, via Freedom of Information requests, to determine whether COVID-regulation breaches were recorded as ASB. The second is natural language processing (NLP) used to interrogate the text details of police ASB records. We find police recording practice varied greatly between areas. We conclude that the early-pandemic increases in recorded ASB were primarily due to breaches of COVID regulations but around half of these also involved traditional forms of ASB. We also suggest that the study offers proof of concept that NLP may have significant general potential to exploit untapped police text records in ways that inform policing and crime policy. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (eg, GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models. Practitioner notes What is currently known about this topic Generating and analysing text-based content are time-consuming and laborious tasks. Large language models are capable of efficiently analysing an unprecedented amount of textual content and completing complex natural language processing and generation tasks. Large language models have been increasingly used to develop educational technologies that aim to automate the generation and analysis of textual content, such as automated question generation and essay scoring. What this paper adds A comprehensive list of different educational tasks that could potentially benefit from LLMs-based innovations through automation. A structured assessment of the practicality and ethicality of existing LLMs-based innovations from seven important aspects using established frameworks. Three recommendations that could potentially support future studies to develop LLMs-based innovations that are practical and ethical to implement in authentic educational contexts. Implications for practice and/or policy Updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models may further reduce the amount of manual effort required for adapting existing models to different educational tasks. The reporting standards of empirical research that aims to develop educational technologies using large language models need to be improved. Adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process could contribute to resolving the practical and ethical challenges of large language models in education. © 2023 The Authors.

It examines how media organisations shape narratives through strategic framing. Employing the Natural Language Processing technique – Topic Modelling – with a generative probabilistic model LDA and a transformer-based language model BERT, the study reveals generic frames elaborated by more specific extensions, shedding light on media portrayal of economy, public opinion, security & defence, external regulations, policy evaluation, and health & safety sectors. Through Named Entity Recognition with roBERTa, Sentiment Analysis with distilBERT, and Corpus Linguistics methods with LancsBox X, interpretation of these overarching frames provides a comprehensive analysis of the nuances in narratives, societal perceptions and policy decisions amidst the ongoing war. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We present an application of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model: to classify an unstructured text into semantically coherent sectors. The main advantage of the recommended methodology is that along with the sector limitations, it produces the topic distribution associated with each sector. We express an alternate methodology that converts message posting data into a text representation and uses topic modelling to identify outlines through the data set. The data were collected from 1,391,549 comments posted in 15 Facebook fan pages between June 2019 and January 2020. We establish that the behaviour possibility of using social media has become progressively relation term; education and entertainment have come to be more significant. By quantifying the sequential movements of topics at the generation level, we found that Thai youth in diverse areas tend to focus on altered sub-domain, while closely generation normally share educational topics. Our discoveries could be of excessive value to academics and policy makers who are interested in classifying encouraging or popular topics. The results demonstrate topic modelling as a beneficial implement for mining significant data from realistic Thai youth social media using behaviours. © 2020 SERSC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recently, promising results have been attained by Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods through trial and error in simulators, bringing confidence in solving cities' congestion problems. However, performance gaps still exist when simulator-trained policies are deployed to the real world. This issue is mainly introduced by the system dynamic difference between the training simulators and the real-world environments. In this work, we leverage the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and profile the system dynamics by a prompt-based grounded action transformation to bridge the performance gap. Specifically, this paper exploits the pre-trained LLM's inference ability to understand how traffic dynamics change with weather conditions, traffic states, and road types. Being aware of the changes, the policies' action is taken and grounded based on realistic dynamics, thus helping the agent learn a more realistic policy. We conduct experiments on four different scenarios to show the effectiveness of the proposed PromptGAT's ability to mitigate the performance gap of reinforcement learning from simulation to reality (sim-to-real).

With the increasing burden of infectious diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for developing novel technologies and integrating internet-based data approaches to improving infectious disease surveillance is greater than ever. In this systematic review, we searched the scientific literature for research on internet-based or digital surveillance for influenza, dengue fever and COVID-19 from 2013 to 2023. We have provided an overview of recent internet-based surveillance research for emerging infectious diseases (EID), describing changes in the digital landscape, with recommendations for future research directed at public health policymakers, healthcare providers, and government health departments to enhance traditional surveillance for detecting, monitoring, reporting, and responding to influenza, dengue, and COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

By using multilingual quantitative text analysis, I show that the electoral salience of minimum wages has increased in the past decades. Although left-wing parties emphasize minimum wages more than right-wing parties, I find that the electoral salience of this policy follows a U-shaped relationship: right-wing populist parties dedicate greater attention to minimum wages than centre-right parties do. A sentiment analysis finds that compared to other policies designed to supplement the income of low-wage workers, such as strengthening collective bargaining institutions and in-work benefits/wage subsidies, there do not seem to be specific party-political characteristics, which determine the sentiment with which discussions on minimum wages are framed. © The Author(s) 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We investigate the impacts of China’s rural human settlement environment policy on rural pollution, focusing on regional variations in policy implementation by provincial governments. Utilizing text-mining methods to compare the policy documents issued by both central and provincial governments, we constructed an indicator termed ‘policy content heterogeneity’ to quantify heterogeneous local implementation behaviors. Based on the panel data from the 2014 and 2016 waves of the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), we used Differences-in-Differences models to analyze the changes in rural human settlement environment among 4,174 rural households across 165 rural communities. Our study found that air, water, and noise pollution have been significantly mitigated among provinces implementing policies with a higher degree of policy content heterogeneity. This study advocates for consideration of regional diversity when formulating and enforcing national policies by constructing policy content heterogeneity as a novel dimension in evaluating local government behavior and underscores the need for continuous research and monitoring of local policy implementation processes. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We go to the roots of changes of fiscal policy in Germany and use a novel data set on all parliamentary speeches in the Bundestag from 1960 to 2021. We propose an embedding-based approach, which allows the representation of words and documents in a shared vector space, in order to measure fiscal policy-related sentiment in parliamentary debates at a scale from contractionary to expansionary. We also distinguish between sentiment related to exogenous and endogenous fiscal policy. We put fiscal sentiment into a series of recursively-identified vector autoregressive models to show that a change in fiscal sentiment causes a shift in government spending and has significant effects on the macroeconomy. The results support the notion that the debate in parliament contains information for the identification of government spending shocks. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The state of government data against political corruption\n                    ABSTRACT: Government data about its own action is a core element of a modern democratic state. Much of this data may help spot conflicts of interest or other instances of compromised decision-making and corruption. Using data from the Global Data Barometer in 67 Open Government Partnership (OGP) member countries, the authors analyze the current gaps in countries data availability across eight policy areas related to political corruption and open government: asset disclosure, political finance, company beneficial ownership, land ownership and tenure, public procurement, lobbying, right to information, and rulemaking. The results show countries still face a range of significant challenges in opening anti-corruption data. In most cases, government datasets are not available as open data and do not include the most useful information, which limits their utility for public oversight. When high-quality datasets are made available to the public, data science applications - including natural language processing and anomaly detection - have proven effective for the detection and prevention of corruption. To maximize benefit from these increasingly popular data approaches, governments must ensure that datasets are open and supported with strong human oversight mechanisms to create a more direct link between transparency and accountability. © The Editor and Contributing Authors Severally 2025.

The model analyzes user emotions and behavior, encompassing anger, fear, joy, anticipation, healthcare and education policies. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a communication framework to examine the interplay between social media dynamics and Pakistan’s political landscape. The proposed hybrid model combines supervised machine learning and deep learning for Twitter-based text classification to assess political perceptions. A total of 52,067 tweets were analyzed and categorized into eight emotion groups. Findings: The study reveals a significant increase in public engagement with social and political discussions on social media. Politicians increasingly leverage social media platforms as tools for communication and propaganda, influencing democratic norms. The proposed hybrid model effectively classified political sentiments and demonstrated high accuracy in analyzing public perceptions of political parties in Pakistan. Practical implications: This research proposes a cost-effective communication framework to enhance public engagement. Political communication offers a methodological baseline for policymakers to understand public opinion and design their communication strategies using prediction models. Originality/value: The study introduces a hybrid approach to evaluate political sentiments by analyzing user emotions and behavior. The comparison of healthcare and education policies adds depth to the analysis and provides valuable information for voters. This research extends agenda-setting theory in the digital era by providing robust and accurate forecasting of policymakers’ agendas which were previously limited. Using machine and deep learning, this research reveals that agenda setting is a reciprocal and dynamic process and is shaped by the digital interplay between media, policymakers and public response. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The econometric analyses show that optimistic tax policy statements stimulate consumption, investment, and output, even after controlling for tax foresight. We also find that consumer sentiment reacts positively to more optimistic tax news, suggesting that sentiment plays an important role in the transmission from U.S. presidential tax policy communication to economic activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

When equipped with access to functions and memory, they can be transformed into interactive and intelligent LLM agents. However, the applicability of such LLM agents in real-time Internet of things (IoT) applications remains constrained by resource limitations. One critical area is IoT security, particularly in intrusion detection systems (IDS), where LLM agents hold the potential to enhance the effectiveness of existing solutions significantly. Current IDS approaches in IoT, predominantly reliant on signature-based or anomaly-based techniques, struggle to adapt to the dynamic and evolving nature of modern threats. Recent studies reveal a prevalence of false positives in existing IDS, complicating the alert reasoning and decision-making process. To address these limitations, this research proposes a novel adaptive IDS policy orchestration framework that leverages LLM agents in conjunction with advanced prompting strategies. Our framework generates adaptive IDS policies, enhancing precision with intelligent alert reasoning. It enables efficient policy deployment without needing LLM inference during policy execution. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments conducted on five real-world IDS datasets. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves over 97% precision on three IoT network datasets and over 80% on two more challenging datasets. Notably, our framework reduces the detection latency by 50% compared to traditional machine learning (ML) models with the requirement of fewer than 10k total completion tokens, offering a highly cost-effective, efficient, and scalable solution. These findings establish a new benchmark for IoT-IDS frameworks utilising LLM agents, underscoring the potential for further advancements in this domain. © 1986-2012 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It is crucial to have specialized expertise and advanced technologies to tackle such challenges. However, the field has unexplored domains, and available solutions are not holistically charted, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the innovation landscape and growth trajectories. This study aims to undertake a patent analysis on mountain transportation and logistics to unveil emerging trends, map technological advancements, and contribute to enhancing transportation systems. Relevant patent documents were extracted from the Derwent Innovation Index database through a keyword search combined with specific International Patent Classification categories. From these documents, technological fields were identified and grouped using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation technique, resulting in 12 clusters. Among them, seat and suspension control systems, intelligent vehicle control systems, electrical systems and electric vehicles, bicycle frame design, and safety devices are likely to attract notable interest in the future. The findings contribute to the academic discourse and hold practical implications for industry and policy stakeholders, offering a nuanced understanding of technological trends crucial for addressing transportation challenges in mountain terrains. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

No policy mining algorithm can produce completely accurate policies, necessitating human intervention to correct errors before implementation. However, humans may fail to revise the produced policies without fully understanding all permission details. In this paper, we propose an on-the-fly framework to assist human revisions by mining usable policies. This framework is formulated as an approximate optimization problem, designed to avoid permission errors and redundancy by balancing submodularity and modular costs through an iterative search for access rules. The search space is guided by two pruning techniques: a tight optimistic estimate to only eliminate unpromising candidates and a queue cutter to sample promising candidates in advance. Experimental evaluations on two real-world and three publicly available synthetic datasets indicate that: 1) our method produces more concise results than existing methods, achieving a 93.2% reduction in redundancy; 2) our method is at least five times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. To further validate the usability of the policies obtained by our approach, we conducted a user study involving 30 participants and 7 large language models (LLMs). The results show that 90.9% of participants, including LLMs such as gpt-4o-mini, successfully modified our mined policies to meet given permission goals. © 2024\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Along with the sharing videos, YouTube creates a social networking platform by allowing sharing of feelings, views, and opinions about a video called vlog. It also allows uploading of videos of all ages (child, young and old people). YouTube has its policy for defining age-restricted content on YouTube. But a lot of uploaded videos are not marked as age restricted though they actually contain pornographic contents. YouTube has a team for reviewing the video content upon receiving a report from the user only. All the existing methods identify the pornographic video based on the visual or audio-visual features of video. However, there is no automatic method exist the author aware of identifying them based on vlogger sentiment. Thus, the challenge of automatically detecting this kind of video content is significant in applications like content filtering, detection of illegal content, etc. In this paper, we present an automatic method for identifying the pornographic content on YouTube based on the vlog stream. The experiment has been executed on both the age-restricted vlog stream and non-restricted vlog stream to validate the proposed method. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with nearly 80% accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These systems assist users to accomplish certain tasks efficiently. However, most commercial TOD systems rely on handcrafted rules and offer functionalities in a single domain. These systems perform well but are not scalable to adapt multiple domains without manual efforts. Pretrained language models (PLMs) have been popularly applied to enhance these systems via fine-tuning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in this field but lack the ability to converse proactively in multiple turns, which is an essential parameter for designing TOD systems. To address these challenges, this paper initially studies the impact of language understanding on the overall performance of a TOD system in a multi-domain environment. Furthermore, to design an efficient TOD system, we propose a unified approach by leveraging LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) based dialogue policy. The experimental results demonstrate that a unified approach using LLM is more promising for scaling the capabilities of TOD systems with prompt adaptive instructions with more user friendly and human-like response generation. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

While existing research conducted policy evaluation from the lens of performance assessment, less study has been devoted to evaluating energy supply policy from the perspective of policy making. This study takes the energy supply policy documents issued by China's central government during the ‘13th Five-Year Plan’ period (2016–2020) as the research sample, and pioneers the use of the extended policy modelling consistency (PMC) index model combined with the text mining methodology to construct a policy evaluation index system with the characteristics of the energy supply policy which conducts a more in-depth quantitative evaluation of the energy supply policy documents. The results show that the average PMC index value of China's energy supply policies is 7.26, and the overall quality is high. The concerns of existing policies are mainly focused on reform and development planning, safety production management and project engineering construction, but there is still room for improvement in policy predictability, coordination of policy areas, clarity of policy basis and goals and comprehensiveness of policy tool combinations. Based on this, China should improve the comprehensiveness of its energy supply policy tool combinations in terms of policy design norm; strengthen policy predictability and coordination of policy areas in terms of policy implementation guarantee; and clarify the basis and goals of policies in terms of policy orientation enhancement, to provide a reference basis for the formulation and improvement of future energy supply policies and to realise the sustainable development of energy supply. © 2023 The Authors.

My analysis reveals that borrowers (especially with non-performing loans) did not actively seek out mortgage forbearance (conditional on communication) in response to this policy, which was intended to prevent a pandemic-induced foreclosure. This is an outcome of the servicer's differential treatment between government and private loans, as the CARES Act was designed for government loans only and left scope for servicer discretion for private loans. These results bring into question the effectiveness of ad hoc laws and the implementation thereof during the COVID-19 pandemic.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM’s inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Methods: After collecting artificial intelligence-and nursing-related news articles published between January 1, 1991, and July 24, 2022, keywords were extracted via preprocessing. A total of 3,267 articles were searched, and 2,996 were used for the final analysis. Text network analysis and topic modeling were performed using NetMiner 4.4. Results: As a result of analyzing the frequency of appearance, the keywords used most frequently were education, medical robot, telecom, dementia, and the older adults living alone. Keyword network analysis revealed the following results: a density of 0.002, an average degree of 8.79, and an average distance of 2.43; the central keywords identified were ’education,’ ‘medical robot,’ and ‘fourth industry.’ Five topics were derived from news articles related to artificial intelligence and nursing: ‘Artificial intelligence nursing research and development in the health and medical field,’ ‘Education using artificial intelligence for children and youth care,’ ‘Nursing robot for older adults care,’ ‘Community care policy and artificial intelligence,’ and ‘Smart care technology in an aging society.’ Conclusion: The use of artificial intelligence may be helpful among the local community, older adult, children, and adolescents. In particular, health management using artificial intelligence is indispensable now that we are facing a super-aging society. In the future, studies on nursing intervention and development of nursing programs using artificial intelligence should be conducted. © 2023, Korean Society of Nursing Science.

In the healthcare domain, patient narratives, through various mediums, have emerged as a valuable source of insight into the experiences of patients and the healthcare system. Recognizing the value of such textual data, diverse analytical methods have been developed, spanning from text mining to narrative analysis. This article presents experiments that combine computational methods, qualitative methods and citizen science for analyzing patients’ stories. In this article, we reflect on two experiments in which we combined these approaches, which we analyze through a generative lens. We distinguish three main effects of the experiments: they provide a platform for discussions as a 'site of controversy'; they act as 'mediator', fostering new connections and mutual understanding among participants; and they serve as 'tin opener', stimulating substantive discussions about methodological development and substantive healthcare matters. Narrative reduction, which occurs when rich narrative data is simplified into structured quantifiable forms, is not inherently problematic; instead, it can be meaningful when combined with qualitative methods and citizen science, emphasizing the importance of utilizing diverse methods to balance authenticity and gaining broader insights. The study highlights the significance of collaborative sense-making and meaning-making in interdisciplinary research. Engaging patients, their relatives, and professionals in the analytical process, facilitated by tools like word clouds, promotes engaged discussions that yield actionable insights. Further development of such interdisciplinary approaches holds promise for a more nuanced understanding of patient experiences, fostering epistemological pluralism, and refining healthcare practices. © The Author(s) 2024.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Government started exploiting the high capabilities and popularity of the social media much later, so there has been much less research concerning their effective utilization by government agencies. This paper contributes to filling this research gap, presenting a novel framework for the effective utilization of the Web 2.0 social media by government agencies for promoting participative governance and applying crowdsourcing ideas. It is based on the centralised automated publishing of content and micro-applications to multiple Web 2.0 social media, and then collection of citizens’ interactions (e.g. comments, ratings) with them, based on central platform that uses efficiently the application programming interfaces (APIs) of these social media. Finally, citizens’ interactions are processed in this central platform using a variety of techniques (web analytics, opinion mining, simulation modelling) in order to provide finally useful analytics that offer substantial support to government decision and policy makers. Furthermore, an application and an evaluation model for the proposed framework are described, as well as an extension of it that combines active/moderated and passive/non-moderated crowdsourcing. © 2013 European and Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems.

This study aims to map the evolution and interdisciplinarity of drought research over time and across regions, offering insights for decision-makers, researchers, and funding agencies. By analysing more than 130 000 peer-reviewed articles indexed in SCOPUS from 1901 to 2022 using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for topic modelling, we identified distinct shifts in research priorities and emerging trends. The results reveal that plant genetic research for drought-tolerant genotypes and advancements in drought forecasting are the most dominant and continuously growing areas of focus. In contrast, the relative importance of topics such as ecology, water resource management, and forest research has decreased. Geospatial patterns highlight a universal focus on forecasting methods, with a strong secondary emphasis on policy and societal issues in Africa and Oceania. Interdisciplinarity in drought research experienced a marked decline until 1983, followed by a steady increase from 2007 onward, suggesting a growing integration of diverse fields. Emerging topics in recent years signal evolving priorities for future research. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of drought research trends across sectors and regions, offering strategic guidance for aligning research efforts with drought resilience goals. The findings are crucial for research funding agencies and policymakers aiming to prioritize areas with the highest potential to mitigate drought impacts effectively. © 2025 Copernicus Publications.

The policy changes led to mixing responses from the public, namely netizens. Netizen shares their opinion in social media, including Twitter. Their opinion can represent the public’s trust in the Government. Sentiment analysis analyses others’ opinions and categorises them into positive opinions, negative opinions, or neutral opinions. Sentiment analysis can analyze large numbers of opinions so that public opinion can be analyzed quickly. This paper explains how to analyze public trust using sentiment analysis and to use Naïve Bayes classification method to analyze sentiment. The data research was taken from Twitter in the first quarter of the Covid-19 pandemic, with around 3000 tweets. The tweets were related to Covid-19 and the Government from several countries such as the United States, Australia, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Canada, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, and Lebanon. This study aims to determine the level of public trust in the Government in the first quarter of the Covid-19 pandemic. The research result is expected to be used as a reference for the public policy stakeholders to determine future policies. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to identify the core characteristics of Saemaul Undong, which was applied as a strategy for rural development in Korea, to analyse the role of government in the implementation process of this policy, and to put forward some implications for the developing countries to be able to apply its principles and the government’s roles for their own rural development. Design/Methodology/Approach. The methods applied to the analysis are text mining analysis and topic modelling analysis, which are widely used in the field of social sciences nowadays. The data em-ployed in this study are the guidelines regarding implementing the Saemaul Undong policy, which was drawn up by former president Park Chung Hee. Results/Discussion. As a result of the analysis, it may be said that the core characteristics of Saemaul Undong policy include: emphasis on the role of Saemaul Undong leaders, financial support from the Government, cooperation of villagers, support from public officials, a spirit of self-help, and movement to promote rural development. Conclusions. In conclusion, it is expected that the principles and implementation methods of the Saemaul Undong policy implemented in Korea in the 1970s can be applied to developing countries suffering from poverty in the future if they are appropriately modified to suit the conditions of developing countries. Originality. So far, the important principles of Saemaul Undong’s policy have not been studied through topic modeling, so fundamental principles have not been derived. This study has great significance be-cause it systematically derived core principles through the topic modeling method. © 2024 The author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The research method included a combination of literature review and text mining. The study found that research on cultured meat in developing countries has focused on consumer attitudes and acceptance, cultural factors, and policy and regulation. Consumer purchase intentions, attitudes, and knowledge levels significantly impact the promotion and adoption of cultured meat. At the same time, cultural factors, religious regulations, and sustainability challenges are also important factors affecting the development of cultured meat in developing countries. Furthermore, developing and implementing policy and regulatory frameworks are critical to fostering the development of sustainable meat systems. Through the combination of literature review and text analysis, this study provides an in-depth look at research on cultured meat in developing countries over the past decade. The findings suggest that consumer attitudes, cultural factors, and sustainability challenges are central topics in cultured meat research in developing countries. However, relatively little research has been done on social acceptance, economic feasibility, and technology adoption. These findings provide important insights for policymakers, researchers, and relevant stakeholders in formulating policies and strategies to advance sustainable food systems. © 2023 The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Despite robust evidence supporting male HPV vaccination, China has yet to approve it. Public discussions on male HPV vaccination, influenced by policy delays, gender norms, and commercialization, reveal diverse attitudes and significant challenges in achieving equitable health outcomes. This study investigates public perceptions and attitudes toward male HPV vaccination in China by analyzing cognitive frames and the social, cultural, and economic factors shaping these discussions. Methods: This study employs a cross-sectional design to analyze 4997 Sina Weibo posts using the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN), identifying five frames: Disease Risk and Prevention, Virus Transmission, Gender Roles and Perceptions, Vaccine Promotion and Acceptance, and Market Dynamics and Consumption. Results: The findings reveal a significant gap between policy implementation and public awareness of male HPV vaccination in China. Despite growing recognition of its benefits, entrenched gender norms and biases hinder equitable health outcomes. Social media, as a pivotal platform for health communication, plays a dual role in facilitating public discourse while also amplifying misinformation. Policy delays and concerns over vaccine commercialization heighten public hesitancy, emphasizing the need for inclusive policies and targeted education. Conclusions: This study highlights the necessity for systemic efforts to address gender biases, enhance public education on male HPV vaccination, and rebuild trust in vaccination programs. A multifaceted approach is required to bridge these gaps, integrating policy reforms, inclusive health communication strategies, and equitable vaccine access. These measures aim to promote awareness and increase vaccination uptake among males in China, ultimately contributing to more comprehensive and equitable public health outcomes. © 2025 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Since citizens who have beneficial awareness or knowledge are not always experts on relevant social issues, assessing and sharing public concerns are needed to reduce barriers to public participation. We propose two approaches to assess public concerns. The first is building a linked open data set by extracting public goals for a specific social issue aimed at by citizens or agents from articles or public opinions. This paper deals with hierarchical goals and subgoals for recovery and revitalization from the Great East Japan Earthquake manually extracted from related articles. The data set can be used for developing services to match citizens and agents who aim at similar goals to facilitate collaboration. The second approach is building a linked data set by extracting assessment criteria for a specific social issue from public opinions. This paper deals with candidate terms that potentially represent such criteria for a specific public project automatically extracted from clusters of citizens' opinions. The data set can be used as evidence for policy-making about the target project. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

A captivating epoch in CR has emerged, and it defies conventional interpretation. We ask how to extract the frontier research topics from patents, which countries are driving innovation in CR, and what policies are contributing to the current situation. This paper uses patent analysis and text mining to study 1831 C R-related patents and finds four clusters from the Derwent Innovations (DI) database. The patent remaining life impact (PRLI) index is calculated. The results show an increase in the number of CR-related patents annually. China leads in the number of patent publications, while the US and other patent organizations have played critical roles in the field. An improved technology evolutionary path tracing visualization identifies several hotspots. Additionally, the policy strategy matrix (PSM) analyzes the industrial stimulation policies of the two countries with the most considerable proportion, providing an explanation for predicting future technology research and development (R&D) and the direction of optimization. © 2024 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Recent developments in sensing technologies and urban computing, however, integrate new data resources and technologies to tackle these challenges. Popular social networking platforms such as Twitter provide new data sources on important events (e.g., cultural activities, political campaigns, accidents, crises) providing rich knowledge about urban systems and human dynamics. This research is intended to develop a method for effectively monitoring important information during such events and helping with planning and policymaking. We use semantically similar and geographically close geo-topics to represent important local events. This research proposes a data-driven system for detecting and tracking the semantic, spatial, and temporal dynamics of these geo-topics, specifically designed for geo-tagged tweets. The system consists of data preprocessing, geo-topic generation, and geo-topic tracking modules. The preprocessing module can remove robotic and semantically trivial texts. In the geo-topic generation module, we use spatial factors to measure the spatial impacts of geo-tagged tweets by applying an exponential decay function to the pairwise distances between tweets. We then improve the dynamic topic model (DTM) by embedding the spatial factors to enable the generation of geo-topics in semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions simultaneously. The geo-topic tracking module monitors semantic change by detecting changes in certain keywords’ probabilities and the volumes of tweets belonging to different geo-topics. This module also uses radius of gyration and trajectory-pattern mining to track and analyze the movement patterns of geo-topics. We employed the tracking system in three disaster cases in different U.S. cities to track small-scale emergencies and crises. These implementations demonstrated the effectiveness of the system for identifying and tracking geo-topics at fine temporal and geographic scales. The system also has strong potential in creating planning-related analyses for policy makers, improving the situational awareness of the general public, and serving as a basis for urban information systems that contribute to smart, agile, and resilient city developments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While scholarly attention has focused on experiences expressed by informal caregivers in these communities, how caregivers’ challenges and emotional expressions vary across different health contexts remains understudied. Objective: We aimed to examine and compare the challenges discussed by informal caregivers of general older adults and those of patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia, as well as their emotional expressions, on Reddit. In addition, we examined how informal caregivers expressed their emotions in response to various challenges. Methods: We collected posts from 6 subreddits, including 3 subreddits on caregiving for older adults and 3 on caregiving for patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia. Using topic modeling, we identified topics discussed by caregivers in the collected posts. We further used deep reading to contextualize these topics and understand the challenges behind them, conducted sentiment analysis to investigate their emotional expressions, and used Spearman rank-order correlation to examine the relationship between the obtained topics and emotions. Results: In total, 3028 posts were retrieved, including 1552 from older adult–related subreddits and 1476 from Alzheimer disease–related subreddits; 18 key topics were identified, with the most frequent topics being expressing feelings (2178/3028, 71.93%) and seeking advice and support (1982/3028, 65.46%). Other topics covered various challenges in caregiving, such as duration of medical care (1954/3028, 64.53%), sleep and incontinence (1536/3028, 50.73%), financial issues (1348/3028, 44.52%), and nursing home (1221/3028, 40.32%). There was a positive, negligible correlation between expressing feelings and seeking advice and support (ρ=0.09, P<.001). Other topics also showed positive, negligible or weak correlations with these 2 topics but in distinct patterns. Posts from older adult–related subreddits were more focused on practical caregiving issues and seeking advice and support, whereas posts from Alzheimer disease–related subreddits emphasized health- and medical-related topics and expressing feelings. Caregivers in both contexts predominantly expressed negative emotions (older adults: 1263/1552, 81.38%; Alzheimer disease: 1247/1476, 84.49%), with caregivers in Alzheimer disease–related subreddits exhibiting slightly greater fear and sadness (P<.001). Specific challenges were significantly correlated with negative emotions: duration of medicalcare was positively, weakly correlated with anger (ρ=0.25, P<.001), fear (ρ=0.25, P<.001), and sadness (ρ=0.22, P<.001). Medical appointments were positively, negligibly correlated with anger (ρ=0.10, P<.001), fear (ρ=0.09, P<.001), and sadness (ρ=0.06, P<.001). Sleep and incontinence (ρ=0.14, P<.001) and finances (ρ=0.24, P<.001) were positively, weakly correlated with anger. Conclusions: By identifying the challenges and feelings expressed by caregivers for general older adults and caregivers for patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia, our findings could inform health practitioners and policy makers in developing more targeted support interventions for informal caregivers in different contexts. ©Nova Mengxia Huang, Liang Ze Wong, Shirley S Ho, Bryan Timothy.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Large language models (LLM), like ChatGPT, are considered a novel solution for delivering online psychological counseling. However, performance evaluation, emotional expression, high levels of anthropomorphism, ethical issues, transparency, and privacy breaches need to be addressed before LLM can be widely adopted. This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT's effectiveness and emotional support capabilities in providing mental health counseling services from both macro and micro perspectives to examine whether it possesses psychological support abilities comparable to those of human experts. Building on the macro-level evaluation, we conducted a deeper comparison of the linguistic differences between ChatGPT and human experts at the micro-level. In addition, to respond to current policy requirements regarding the labeling, we further explored how to identify artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) in counseling texts and which micro-level linguistic features can effectively distinguish AIGC from user-generated content (UGC). Finally, the study addressed transparency, privacy breaches, and ethical concerns. We utilized ChatGPT for psychological interventions, applying LLM to address various mental health issues. The BERTopic algorithm evaluated the content across multiple mental health problems. Deep learning techniques were employed to differentiate between AIGC and UGC in psychological counseling responses. Furthermore, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) evaluate interpretability, providing deeper insights into the decision-making process and enhancing transparency. At the macro level, ChatGPT demonstrated performance comparable to human experts, exhibiting professionalism, diversity, empathy, and a high degree of human likeness, making it highly effective in counseling services. At the micro level, deep learning models achieved accuracy rates of 99.12 % and 96.13 % in distinguishing content generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 from UGC, respectively. Interpretability analysis revealed that context, sentence structure, and emotional expression were key factors differentiating AIGC from UGC. The findings highlight ChatGPT's potential to deliver effective online psychological counseling and demonstrate a reliable framework for distinguishing between artificial intelligence-generated and human-generated content. This study underscores the importance of leveraging large-scale language models to support mental health services while addressing high-level anthropomorphic issues and ethical and practical challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims (a) to analyze the participation behavior of the elderly in leisure sports through big-data analysis and (b) to compare and analyze the motivations, limitations, and satisfaction of participation in leisure sports by age group. Methods: First, big-data analysis using text-mining technique was conducted using the TEXTOM program to collect and analyze data between May 1, 2023 and November 24, 2024. Next, a survey was conducted among adults aged 20 years and older who regularly participate in leisure sports to determine their motivations, limitations, and satisfaction with leisure participation. From June to December 2024, the data of 301 participants were collected and analyzed using SPSS 28.0. Specifically, this study analyzed the validity and reliability of the data and then compared and analyzed the three age groups through multivariate analysis of variance. Results: Big-data analysis identified key terms and four clusters related to senior leisure sports participation: (a) Policy, (b) Welfare, (c) Senior Sports, and (d) Employment. The results of the comparative study through the questionnaire showed that compared to younger participants in leisure sports, the elderly showed higher results in the factors of self-challenge motive, social interaction motive, and leisure participation satisfaction, but lower results in the factor of cost constraints. This means that the elderly participate in leisure sports for challenge and social interaction, are more satisfied, and are less constrained by cost. Conclusions: The scientific and objective results of this study could be used as a resource to specifically understand the leisure sports participation behavior of the elderly. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We use text mining techniques to reveal overlapping and exclusive terminologies used in academic articles on the three types of ecosystems. Processing of keywords has identified the current positioning of related domains in a tripartite framework. Keywords Network Analysis has revealed domains that share knowledge with the larger domains of Smart City, Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) and Helix interaction concepts, thereby providing insights into knowledge sharing across boundaries of BE, IE and DE. The results offer a basis for classification and baseline of current state of knowledge distribution across the ecosystems that can aid in ecosystems design, collaborations planning, interdisciplinary research and policy making. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The method, entirely based on textual analysis has two steps: (a) multi-terms selected from a policy document are used to retrieve documents from a publication database, (b) a LDA topic model fitted to the retrieved corpus allows to identify irrelevant topics and to remove the corresponding documents. Once the corpus is cleaned, topics are clustered on the base of their semantic proximities and of their co-occurrence in documents for structuring the domain into main research themes. The method is applied to a selected facet of the food security challenge and provides a representative sample of research works in the domain. Structuring the corpus into six research themes allows to compare the thematic profiles and the research practices of twelve countries most involved in the domain. © 2015 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Recent works based on this paradigm have achieved state-of-the-art results in several of the mostly deterministic offline Atari and D4RL benchmarks. However, because these methods jointly model the states and actions as a single sequencing problem, they struggle to disentangle the effects of the policy and world dynamics on the return. Thus, in adversarial or stochastic environments, these methods lead to overly optimistic behavior that can be dangerous in safety-critical systems like autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a method that addresses this optimism bias by explicitly disentangling the policy and world models, which allows us at test time to search for policies that are robust to multiple possible futures in the environment. We demonstrate our method's superior performance on a variety of autonomous driving tasks in simulation.

For complex business processes, this results in huge amount of policy documents. Given the large volume of policies, manually analyzing policy documents to discover process information imposes excessive cognitive load. In order to provide a solution to this problem, we have proposed previously a novel approach named Policy-based Process Mining (PBPM) to automatically extracting process models from policy documents using information extraction techniques. In this paper, we report our recent findings in an important PBPM step called task identification. Our investigation indicates that task identification from policy documents is quite challenging because it is not a typical information extraction problem. The novelty of our approach is to formalize task identification as a problem of extracting relations among three process components, i.e., resource, action, and data while using sequence kernel techniques. Our initial experiment produced very promising results.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, few have deployed the content analysis of the joint statements between both countries in order to grasp the change of the relationship in different time frames. In fact, grasping the trend change of the US-China relationship is imperative for academic researchers and policy makers. In this paper, we analyzed the trend change of the US-China relationship by means of applying the text mining analysis to two joint statements in the years of 2009 and 2011. The contribution of this study included the following two points. First, the study has found the main focus of the Joint Statements shifted from mutual cooperation to the focuses of economic development, investment and the continuity of bilateral relations. Second, the study found a new way of literature survey in diplomatic studies by using the text mining method in order to explore the trend change. © Sila Science.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this paper, we perform a sentiment analysis for measuring long-term trends in public opinion during the 2016 Indian demonetisation policy using Twitter data. We compare our findings to prior research and reports retrieved from media and sources. We utilise Rapid Miner sentiment classifier to a post-event of extending the deadline to deposit the forfeit banknotes. The results indicate an attitude that is predominantly continuing to oppose towards demonetisation policy implementation. We recommend from this study that a multi-lingual sentiment be employed to process non-polarised tweets in local languages in future work. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Politicians are generally seeking effective public policies that favourably impacts citizens' satisfaction. Citizen satisfaction index is a plausible mechanism for public policy makers to monitor and evaluate the public policies. While surveys on citizen satisfaction are common among agile and progressive public administration and governments, automating the computation of citizen's' satisfaction is challenging. Given that surveys and evaluations related to citizen satisfaction are retrospective, remedial actions when necessary are always somewhat late. We describe in this poster a predictive analytics framework for citizen satisfaction with respect to public policy based on the previous citizen sentiments past related policies. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Despite the essential role of institutions in facilitating the transition to renewable energy, systematic research on this relationship remains scarce. This study addresses this gap by being the first to apply Topic Modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation – LDA) to systematically analyze the literature, offering a data-driven alternative to conventional reviews and minimizing subjective bias. We hypothesize that the interaction between institutional quality and renewable energy is multifaceted, with key areas influencing each other in an interconnected manner. To test this, we apply LDA to analyze 570 academic documents published from 1998 to 2024. The analysis identifies five prominent topics: Investments (17.2 %), Emissions (22.3 %), Finance (17.3 %), Environment (20.2 %), and Economic growth (23 %). Most documents exhibit a maximum probability of belonging to a topic within 25 %–35 %, with some reaching 40 %–50 %. Although a moderate negative correlation is observed between topics, overlapping themes and interconnections are discovered. By leveraging LDA, this study systematically categorizes and analyzes research trends, offering an objective and scalable method to uncover latent themes in the discourse on institutional quality and renewable energy. By exploring these interrelationships, this study offers valuable insights for future research and policy development, providing a robust foundation for advancing global sustainable energy transition. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This method can learn a group's preference by automatically integrating its members preferences without integrating policy, and analyze group/user preferences and understand group/user behaviors by using multi-view text mining. Specifically, in order to integrate rich group to item interaction information into the model, we designed a graph convolution network (GCN) model based on multi-topic learning, and denote the new model as topic-based graph convolution network via LLM (T-GCN-LLM). By applying graph convolutions on the multi-topic association graphs, the model can make a comprehensive representations for groups and users through using embeddings contained in multiple topics, so as to improve the group recommendations. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to evaluate the T-GCN-LLM, the results demonstrate that our model can better represent the interactions between groups and items than many novel and high quality group recommendation methods. At the same time, the interpretability analysis experiment also proves the importance of incorporating the topics into the model to improve the interpretability of group recommendations. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The results of the emerging theory explain that the concerns of users can be categorized as relating to data management, data surveillance, data invasion, technical safety, or legal & policy issues. The results show that over time, mHealth users are still concerned about areas such as security breaches, real-time data invasion, surveillance, and how companies use the data collected from these devices. Further, the results from the emotion and sentiment analyses revealed that users generally exhibited anger and fear, and sentiments that were negatively expressed. Theoretically, the results also support the literature on user acceptance of mHealth wearables as influenced by the distrust of companies and their utilization of personally harvested data. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

While accomplishments in this regard are constantly measured, European citizens are not always aware of the policy‘s impact and the role the EU plays therein. This is especially relevant as the communication of EU policies is central to the emergence of a European public sphere, an acknowledged condition for European integration. In this paper, we aim at advancing research in this regard through the analysis of cohesion policy communication on the social media channels of ten Local Managing Authorities (LMAs) responsible for managing and communicating structural funds at the local level. By building on a bottom-up construction of shared meaning structures through semi-automatic analysis techniques, we make the following three observations: first, social media communication is indicative of ‘horizontal Europeanization'; second, Europeanization occurs both in the form of the spontaneous amalgamation of shared discontent expressed by citizens and the institutionalization of top-down EU communication measures adopted by LMAs; and third, a cluster of topics articulated internationally and showcasing a negative attitude towards the EU funding scheme suggests that, counter-intuitively, Euroscepticism seems to facilitate the emergence of a European public sphere. © 2020 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Considering that microblogged geo-locational information offers new insight into human attitudes, the present research examined the utility of geo-social media data for understanding how different active and inactive travel modes affect feelings of pleasure, or displeasure, in two major US cities: Chicago, Illinois and Washington DC. A popular approach was used to derive a sentiment index (pleasure or valence) for each travel Tweet. Methodologically, exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and global and spatial regression models were used to examine the geography of all travel modes and factors affecting their valence. After adjusting for spatial error associated with socioeconomic, environmental, weather and temporal factors, spatial autoregression models proved superior to the base global model. The results showed that water and pedestrian travel were universally associated with positive valences. Bicycling also favourably influenced valence, albeit only in DC. A noteworthy finding was the negative influence temperature and humidity had on valence. The outcomes from this research should be considered when additional evidence is needed to elevate commuter sentiment values in practice and policy, especially in regards to active transportation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We extract several latent topics of interest to the community from the text corpus by applying the unsupervised learning method of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and explore the amount of interests received by each topic by applying the supervised learning methods, including the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and the Bayesian LASSO model. Results reveal much more attentions paid by the audience to the sensational news, especially the controversies related to Hillary Clinton’s email leakage and Donald Trump’s anti-political-correctness and anti-globalization remarks, than to the substantive issues, e.g., regarding the candidates’ policy agendas or the democratic process. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In fulfilling the present legal gap, enacted soft law regulation has been laid out, and a detailed systematic literature review was conducted in the paper presented. The specific methodological approach was selected to deal with two crucial research tasks: to reveal and recommend fundamental governing mechanisms regarding the use and application of generative artificial intelligence; more precisely, large language models in educational systems. Three systematically guided layers of quantitative and qualitative content analysis of central policy, legislation, and regulatory mechanisms in governing AI in education were extracted from the 142 Scopus Database and Web of Science research papers analyzed and presented. These research findings benefit policymakers, regulatory and legislative bodies, and agencies in constructing governing frames for using and applying generative artificial intelligence in education. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this work, we posit that personalizing access to decision support tools can be an effective mechanism for instantiating the appropriate use of AI assistance. Specifically, we propose the general problem of learning a decision support policy that, for a given input, chooses which form of support to provide to decision-makers for whom we initially have no prior information. We develop Modiste, an interactive tool to learn personalized decision support policies. Modiste leverages stochastic contextual bandit techniques to personalize a decision support policy for each decision-maker. In our computational experiments, we characterize the expertise profiles of decision-makers for whom personalized policies will outperform offline policies, including population-wide baselines. Our experiments include realistic forms of support (e.g., expert consensus and predictions from a large language model) on vision and language tasks. Our human subject experiments add nuance to and bolster our computational experiments, demonstrating the practical utility of personalized policies when real users benefit from accessing support across tasks.

In concert with these technological changes, students are also facing increasing pressure to succeed in their academic pursuits. Inasmuch as the consequences of failure in these contexts are often dire academically, socially, and financially, we argue that students often weigh the choice to plagiarize not as an ethical issue but as a pragmatic mitigation of risk. Using three salient examples of plagiarism and cheating from higher education in North America as case studies, we explore the pressures and contexts that have influenced the choice to engage in plagiarism and cheating through this pragmatic lens. As an ethical framing of the issue of academic integrity has been less effective in ameliorating plagiarism in this pressurized climate, we propose a way in which educators, administrators and policy makers might approach the issue in this same pragmatic frame. In short, rather than combat plagiarism by teaching its moral repugnance, we propose educators could argue instead that plagiarism and cheating are pragmatically untenable simply because they are detrimental to learning. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

PCG is defined as the generation of game content tailored to the defined evaluation function using RL models, which is one of the examples of PCG via machine learning. Compared to other generation content areas such as computer vision and natural language process, generative models such as variational autoencoders, PixelCNN, and generative adversarial networks exhibit some difficulties for applications to the game area because during the development of a new game, the content data used for training is typically not sufficient. Hence, RL is considered to be used as a method for PCG. In particular, the stage of turn-based RPG is selected as our research target because it comprises discrete sections, and its parameters were closely related; hence, it is a challenge to generate desirable stages, and the main goal is to generate various stages guided by the designed evaluation function. Two RL models, Deep Q-Network and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, respectively, are selected, and the generated stages are evaluated as 0.78 and 0.85 by our designed function, respectively. By the application of the stochastic noise policy, diverse stages are successfully obtained, and those diversities are evaluated by the parameter mse and the different number of valid strategies. © 2019 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, while most land bank-related studies have focused on socioeconomic dynamics (income levels, unemployment rate, etc.) through the program, there is a lack of direct research on residential satisfaction changes. Additionally, surveys were frequently used in previous studies to evaluate residential satisfaction; however, this method has disadvantages, including constraints on time and cost, and the inability to take into account external factors that may affect residential satisfaction. Furthermore, most studies on urban decline have focused primarily on declining factors, and there have been few investigations into how cities change as urban regeneration strategies advance. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to identify the influence of the land bank program on residential satisfaction by using Twitter data. Approximately 300,000 Twitter posts containing location information generated within the city of Detroit were collected to determine the degree of sensitivity to each tweet and categorized into positive and negative emotions to determine the relationship between residential satisfaction and the land bank program. As a result, the increase in homeownership, built year, house value, and the number of land banking sold properties were found to have a negative effect on neighborhood satisfaction in Detroit. Although the research results indicated that while the land bank program did not significantly improve residential satisfaction in Detroit, it has made a partial contribution to improving living standards. These findings emphasize the importance of enhancing residential satisfaction and suggest the need for policy change. In response to the problem of urban contraction, it seems that indiscriminately distributing houses is not the only solution to prevent urban shrinkage. Furthermore, this study shows meaningful results on text mining and provides the possibility of developing research using social network services. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The aim is to provide targeted guidance for government policy￣making and public opinion governance. Specifically, this paper utilizes social networks represented by Weibo, based on the divided public opinion lifecycle and stakeholders, and integrates Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) topic modeling, ERNIE 3.0 sentiment analysis, and word co￣occurrence network analysis methods to conduct an in￣depth analysis of online comments related to unexpected natural disasters from multiple dimensions of content features, spatiotemporal characteristics, and network characteristics. This reveals the evolution characteristics of public opinion among various stakeholders in the public opinion events of heavy rain and flood in Hebei. The research results show that ordinary netizens have focused and diverse concerns, while online media focuses on centralized and singular themes. Opinion leaders tend to capitalize on traffic, and official media focuses on disaster warnings and reassuring the public. It is worth noting that in addition to the disaster￣stricken areas, the locations of major media outlets, which are high￣risk areas for public opinion crises, should also be given priority attention, and relevant departments urgently need to strengthen the guidance and supervision of public opinion in the latter. The method proposed in this paper not only improves the accuracy of topic mining, but also achieves accurate characterization of the multi￣dimensional characteristics of different stakeholders in each public opinion cycle. This research can provide targeted guidance and emergency plans for online public opinion crises triggered by unexpected natural disasters such as heavy rain and floods. © 2025 Institute of Engineering Mechanics (IEM).

Specifically, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a dataset of manually annotated sentences on monetary policy stance. We derive a deep learning domain-specific model—BERT central bank sentiment index—ready for sentiment predictions. The proposed index performs similarly to other measures in capturing financial uncertainty. Also, the sentiment index is less noisy and has the ability to forecast the future path of policy stance, augmenting the standard Taylor rule. Finally, compared to other lexicon-based sentiment indicators, our deep learning index has a higher predictive power in anticipating policy rates changes. Our framework enables future possible research in developing more accurate sentiment indicators for central banks in both advanced and emerging countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

With access policy governance now an executive-level responsibility, it is imperative that such a tool expose the policy to business users - with little or no IT intervention - as natural language. NIST SP 800-162. [1] first prescribes natural language policies (NLPs) as the preferred expression of policy and then implicitly calls for automated translation of NLP to machine-executable code. This paper therefore proposes an interoperable model for the NLP's human expression. It furthermore documents the research and development of a tool set for end-to-end authoring and translation. This R&D journey - focusing constantly on end users - has debunked certain myths, has responded to steadily increasing market sophistication, has applied formal disciplines (e.g. ontologies, grammars and compiler design) and has motivated an informal demonstration of autonomic code generation. The lessons learned should be of practical value to the entire ABAC community. The research in progress - increasingly complex policies, proactive rule analytics, and expanded NLP authoring language support - will require collaboration with an ever-expanding technical community from industry and academia. © 2017 ACM.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

As a consequence, modelling, measuring and monitoring the rate and direction of technological change has been extensively studied. However, there is to-date no scalable, cross-domain, and data source agnostic quantitative indicator for technological change that considers a combinatorial process of invention and technology development. This paper develops and empirically tests a network-based method that takes a combinatorial view of technological development as underlying rationale and provides a quantitative indicator for technological change. Unlike prior research, the proposed method allows for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple and diverse types of data sources, i.e. publications, patents, and projects and it uses text-mining analyses based on co-occurrences of terms over time. The novel method proposed here goes beyond reliance on domain experts building custom sets of taxonomies, is applicable across different technological domains, and permits a temporal analysis of changes across years, industries, and countries. This is illustrated using a large database of worldwide bioenergy research and development (R&D) records. Findings include the detection of biofuel generations in the data before they were first mentioned as such in literature. Implications for research, industry and policy are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Many organizations are adopting information security management systems and pursuing certifications like ISO 27001. However, the process of creating and maintaining these policies is often manual and time-consuming. Organizations must merge requirements from different frameworks and stay updated with evolving regulations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models, specifically fine-tuning a pretrained BERT model. Our research focuses on automatically identifying and matching cybersecurity requirements, particularly those outlined in ISO 27001. This approach aims to support the merging of requirements from various frameworks into a unified policy and ensure the consistency of company-specific policies with updated frameworks over time. By utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques and the power of BERT, we aim to streamline the process of policy creation and maintenance, reducing manual effort and enabling organizations to stay compliant with changing regulations. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

Therefore, the current study offers a literature review targeting tourism and hospitality stakeholders’ perceptions of past diseases and has three objectives: (1) Explore major topics from previous research on infectious diseases using topic modeling; (2) compare non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 crises; (3) investigate research topics in the tourism and hospitality industries. To meet our research objectives, we reviewed published pandemic-related articles in the tourism and hospitality literature since the year 2000. Based on the results, we first identified nine key topics related to infectious diseases (i.e., policy, human resources, branding, resilience, technology, global or community change, risk perception, disease impact, and lifestyle). Second, we suggest the application of different topic weights in non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 research. Third, we found that it is appropriate to apply different topic weights in tourism and hospitality research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Using Natural Language Processing to Read 461 California City General Plans\n                    ABSTRACT: Land-use control is local and highly varied. State agencies struggle to assess plan contents. Similarly, advocacy groups and planning researchers wrestle with the length of planning documents and ability to compare across plans. The goal of this research is to (1) introduce Natural Language Processing techniques that can automate qualitative coding in planning research and (2) provide policy-relevant exploratory findings. We assembled a database of 461 California city-level General Plans, extracted the text, and used topic modeling to identify areas of emphasis (clusters of co-occurring words). We find that California city general plans address more than sixty topics, including greenhouse gas mitigation and Climate Action Planning. Through spatializing results, we find that a quarter of the topics in plans are regionally specific. We also quantify the rift and convergence of planning topics. The topics focused on housing have very little overlap with other planning topics. This is likely a factor of state requirements to update and evolve the Housing Elements every five years, but not other aspects of General Plans. This finding has policy implications as housing topics evolve away from other emphasis areas such as transportation and economic development. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach reveals that many cities have had a focus on environmental justice through Health and Wellness Elements well before the state mandate in 2019. Our searchable state-level database of general plans is the first for California—and nationally. We provide a model for others that wish to comprehensively assess and compare plan contents using machine learning. © The Author(s) 2021.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this way, the healthcare providers and the policy makers can acquire and process the data of a patient despite its initial format and source, allowing an improved quality of patient care and optimizing the management of the financial resources. To further exploit this huge resource of health and social data, it is very important to allow the extraction of the complex information buried under the Big Data source enabled by the EHRs, providing the physicians, the researchers and public health policy makers with innovative instruments. Meeting this need is not a trivial task, due to the difficulties of processing different document formats and processing Natural Language text, alongside to the problems related to the data size. In this paper we propose a Big Data architecture that is able to extract information from the documents acquired by the EHRs, integrate and process them, providing a set of valuable data for both physicians and patients, as well as decision makers. © 2019 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

At this stage, the opposition to the vaccine seen in the society or the lack of trust in the developed vaccine is an important factor hampering vaccination activities. In this study, aspect-base sentiment analysis was conducted for USA, U.K., Canada, Turkey, France, Germany, Spain and Italy showing the approach of twitter users to vaccination and vaccine types during the COVID-19 period. Within the scope of this study, two datasets in English and Turkish were prepared with 928,402 different vaccine-focused tweets collected by country. In the classification of tweets, 4 different aspects (policy, health, media and other) and 4 different BERT models (mBERT-base, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT and BERTurk) were used. 6 different COVID-19 vaccines with the highest frequency among the datasets were selected and sentiment analysis was made by using Twitter posts regarding these vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to understand people's views about vaccination and types of vaccines. With the experiments conducted, the results of the views of the people on vaccination and vaccine types were presented according to the countries. The success of the method proposed in this study in the F1 Score was between 84% and 88% in datasets divided by country, while the total accuracy value was 87%.  © 2013 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Drawing on resource dependence theory and informational perspectives on parliamentary committees, we analyse the impact of information provided by business interest organizations, public interest groups, and experts in the German Bundestag’s public hearings in 2004, 2007, and 2011. Using a text-reuse approach to capture legislative amendments, we assess the influence of different information types in explaining such changes. Our results show that the Bundestag often amends government proposals, and that interest groups’ positions and experts’ evidence must be considered when explaining such amendments. We demonstrate that parliament is more responsive to business pressure than to public interest groups, which are heavily dependent on political allies in governing parties. Finally, we show that expert advice can inform policy-makers and legitimize government bills, but can also disempower public interest groups. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Exploring Indian Parliamentary debates helps grasp their linguistic characteristics, rhetorical strategies, and political implications. Analysing speeches aims to understand how language is used to persuade, argue, and negotiate in this context, shedding light on the dynamics of Indian democracy and parliamentary discourse. This research paper highlights the use of natural language processing to comprehend the hidden patterns in Lok Sabha’s speeches, aka the House of People, which were collected from its official website. 5000 speeches were extracted, and a subset was manually annotated into five categories—Appreciate, Neutral, Call For Action, Blame, and Issue. The data was preprocessed to determine the sentiment, key phrases, similarity, gender distribution, and category classification. Multiple baseline machine learning models were implemented, such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SGD classifiers, and deep neural networks. The logistic regression model gave the best performance with an accuracy of 55%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

South Korea occupational safety and health has implemented new policies addressing potential risks to overcome stagnation in industrial accident reduction and predict site accidents from past cases. Cases are human-classified according to rules, including occurrence type or original causal materials. However, human errors, subjective judgments, synonyms, and terms incorrectly used by classifiers reduce original data quality and impede developments or applications of policies, technologies, and methods preventing accidents based on past accidents. This study proposes three artificial intelligence models to objectively classify the occurrence type of accident cases. Models are developed based on a natural language processing model (KoBERT), which considers Korean language characteristics. Each model is tested by sequentially performing sentence preprocessing, keyword replacement, and morphological analysis. The proposed Model 3 exhibits 93.1% accuracy, which was the highest among tested models. Up to three classification categories for occurrence type are allowed to assist objective classification. The accident case-based occurrence type classification model is effective for industrial accident prevention, aiding in strategy development and reducing social costs. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Online news articles are one of the main data sources that present up-to-date business news offered by various companies in the market. Topic modeling, i.e. a key player in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, helps businesses to drive value from news articles. Also, it supports the extraction of business insights from news articles to facilitate the identification of trends (topics) in the market and their evolution over time. These insights can help businesses not only automate routine tasks but also in building new marketing policies, decision-making, and customer support. It is also important to find the linked semantic information (i.e. key persons, organizations, or regions called named entities) involved in generating these topics for the identification of news sources. This paper presents the application of a hybrid approach based on dynamic topic modeling and Named-Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting business trends along with the related entities. To show the functionality of the proposed approach, the news articles collected from the websites that published the content related to company interests were from 2017 to 2021 inclusive. The proposed approach can serve as the foundation for future exploratory trend analysis to study the evolution of information not only in the business domain but also applicable in other domains.

Transforming the operation of businesses has been possible because of the astonishing speed at which technology has witnessed the change. The automotive industry is on the edge of a revolution. The increased customer expectations, changing ownership, self-driving vehicles, and much more have led to the transformation of automobiles, applications, and services from artificial intelligence, sensors, RFID to big data analysis. Large automobile industries have been emphasizing the collection of data to gain insight into customer’s expectations, preferences, and budgets alongside competitor’s policies. Statistical methods can be applied to historical data, which has been gathered from various authentic sources and can be used to identify the impact of fixed and variable marketing investments and support automakers to come up with a more effective, precise, and efficient approach to target customers. Proper analysis of supply chain data can disclose the weak links in the chain enabling the adoption of timely countermeasures to minimize the adverse effects. To fully gain benefit from analytics, the collaboration of a detailed set of capabilities responsible for intersecting and integrating with multiple functions and teams across the business is required. The effective role played by big data analysis in the automobile industry has also been expanded in the research paper. The research paper discusses the scope and challenges of big data. The paper also elaborates on the working technology behind the concept of big data. The paper illustrates the working of MapReduce technology that executes in the back end and is responsible for performing data mining. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Product reviews, trends, and political commentary can all be found on Twitter. Twitter may be used to assess public sentiment toward current events, legislation, social movements and public figures, as well as the attitudes, feelings and opinions of various individuals. Opinion mining can be accomplished without manually reading tweets using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. This data can be used to launch new policies, products, and events by governments and corporations alike. When it comes to categorising tweets according to their emotional content, there are a number of models that have been developed for classifying tweets as love, joy, sad, anger, fear, anxiety. The proposed Ensemble Classifier (LSTM-GRU) was determined to be the most effective after a thorough evaluation of its performance.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

What has been largely missing in the literature is the temporal dimension, i.e., the changes over time in key variables such as organizational environment, firm strategic adaptations, and the performance implications. In this study, we investigate environment and strategic adaptations 12 years after Tan and Litschert examined these issues in 1990. Following a staged model, the study found that (1) organizational environment and firm strategic adaptations have co-evolved over time, (2) a new configuration has emerged and is related to improved performance, and (3) such a relationship is moderated by the stage during transition in which firms were founded. Specifically, firms founded since 1990 are more proactive and innovative than firms that had existed in the previous stage.

Twitter has attracted the attention of many researchers owing to the fact that every tweet is by default, public in nature which is not the case with Facebook. This paper proposes a model for multi-lingual (English and Roman Urdu) classification of tweets over diversely ranged classes (non-hierarchical architecture). Previous work in tweet classification is narrowly focused either on single language or either on uniform set of classes at most (Positive, Extremely Positive, Negative and Extremely Negative). The proposed model is based on semi-supervised learning and proposed feature selection approach makes it less dependent and highly adaptive for grabbing trending terms. This makes it a strong contender of choice for streaming data. In the methodology, using Naïve Bayes learning algorithm for each phase, obtained remarkable accuracy of up to 87.16% leading from both KNN and SVM models which are popular for NLP and Text classification domains. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These efforts have resulted in different QA models capable of answering questions on various topics. Research shows that existing QA models perform well on generic questions (e.g., about sports, news, and common knowledge); however, the ability of QA models to answer basic but important questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies is unknown. In this paper, we first derived a set of 43 basic questions concerning mobile apps’ privacy policies based on global privacy laws. Then, we constructed two datasets of labeled (Passage, Question, Answer) 3-tuples. Finally, we conducted two main experiments to evaluate the ability and effectiveness of existing QA models in answering basic questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies. Our experimental results show that (1) existing QA models perform poorly in answering basic questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies, and (2) fine-tuning existing QA models using our QA datasets can help improve their performance. We hope our datasets and findings can help researchers build better QA models for more accurately answering questions about mobile apps’ privacy policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Design/methodology/approach: To test the proposed conjectures, the authors collected longitudinal data in collaboration with a leading company that operates more than 500 WeChat official accounts in China. This study proposed a text mining framework to extract and quantify clickbait rhetorical features (i.e. hyperbole, insinuation, puzzle, and visual rhetoric). Econometric analysis was employed for empirical validation. Findings: The findings revealed that (1) hyperbole, insinuation, and visual rhetoric entice users to click the baited headlines, (2) there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of clickbait headlines posted by a publisher and its visit traffic, and (3) this non-linear relationship is moderated by the publisher's age. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes to current literature on clickbait detection and clickbait consequences. Future studies can design more sophisticated methods for extracting rhetorical characteristics and implement in different languages. Practical implications: The findings could aid online media publishers to design attractive headlines and develop clickbait strategies to avoid user churn, and help managers enact appropriate regulations and policies to control clickbait prevalence. Originality/value: The authors propose a novel text mining framework to quantify rhetoric embedded in clickbait. This study empirically investigates antecedents and consequences of clickbait prevalence through an exploratory study of WeChat in China. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Conventional approaches to decision making face challenges related to low sample efficiency and poor generalization. In contrast, foundation models in language and vision have showcased rapid adaptation to diverse new tasks. Therefore, we advocate for the construction of foundation agents as a transformative shift in the learning paradigm of agents. This proposal is underpinned by the formulation of foundation agents with their fundamental characteristics and challenges motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we specify the roadmap of foundation agents from large interactive data collection or generation, to self-supervised pretraining and adaptation, and knowledge and value alignment with LLMs. Lastly, we pinpoint critical research questions derived from the formulation and delineate trends for foundation agents supported by real-world use cases, addressing both technical and theoretical aspects to propel the field towards a more comprehensive and impactful future.

Factors such as the high incidence of both emerging and existing infectious diseases, delays in vaccinations, and routine exposure in communal settings heighten children's susceptibility to infections. Despite this pressing need, a comprehensive exploration of research trends in this domain remains lacking. This study aims to address this gap by employing text mining and modeling techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature, thereby identifying emerging research trends in infectious disease prevention among children. Methods: A cross-sectional text mining approach was adopted, focusing on journal articles published between January 1, 2003, and August 31, 2022. These articles, related to infectious disease prevention in children, were sourced from databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, and Korean RISS. The data underwent preprocessing using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python, with a semantic network analysis and topic modeling conducted using R software. Results: The final dataset comprised 509 journal articles extracted from multiple databases. The study began with a word frequency analysis to pinpoint relevant themes, subsequently visualized through a word cloud. Dominant terms encompassed “vaccination,” “adolescent,” “infant,” “parent,” “family,” “school,” “country,” “household,” “community,” “HIV,” “HPV,” “COVID-19,” “influenza,” and “diarrhea.” The semantic analysis identified “age” as a key term across infection, control, and intervention discussions. Notably, the relationship between “hand” and “handwashing” was prominent, especially in educational contexts linked with “school” and “absence.” Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling further delineated seven topics related to infectious disease prevention for children, encompassing (1) educational programs, (2) vaccination efforts, (3) family-level responses, (4) care for immunocompromised individuals, (5) country-specific responses, (6) school-based strategies, and (7) persistent threats from established infectious diseases. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the indispensable role of personalized interventions tailored for various child demographics, highlighting the pivotal contributions of both parental guidance and school participation. Clinical Relevance: The study provides insights into the complex public health challenges associated with preventing and managing infectious diseases in children. The insights derived could inform the formulation of evidence-based public health policies, steering practical interventions and fostering interdisciplinary synergy for holistic prevention strategies. © 2024 Sigma Theta Tau International.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

As a result of the Korea Housing Survey in 2020, the percentage of households living in apartments among general households in Korea was 51.1%, but there is insufficient research to understand public perception and trends of the balcony vegetable gardens. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the trends of balcony vegetable gardens over the last 4 years including before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and to provide basic data for effective application to related policies and research. Methods: A total of 5,011 posts that mentioned balcony vegetable gardens were collected from Naver blogs and cafes from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2021. To tokenize nouns, Okt morphological analysis of KoNLPy was used, and keywords were derived using TfidfVectorizer of Scikit-learn library. Following that, LDA topic modeling was performed by setting the hyper parameters as α= 0.1, β = 0.01 and iterations = 1,000. The above analysis was conducted using Python 3.9.5. Results: Before the outbreak of COVID-19, balcony vegetable gardening began to receive attention and vitalized as a form of participation in urban agriculture, but after the outbreak, they are established as an activity for healing, emotional support, environmental campaign, and healthy hobby. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, people clearly seemed to seek a more sustainable lifestyle through balcony vegetable garden activities. This shows the values and expected outcomes the public has toward urban agriculture. Conclusion: Balcony gardening activities heal the public, and this healing effect could be a key to the revitalization and development of urban agriculture.

Approximately 800,000 individuals die by suicide yearly, and for every suicide death, there are another 20 estimated suicide attempts. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to enhance scalable, accessible, and affordable digital services for suicide prevention and self-harm interventions. However, their use also raises clinical and ethical questions that require careful consideration. Objective: This scoping review aims to identify emergent trends in LLM applications in the field of suicide prevention and self-harm research. In addition, it summarizes key clinical and ethical considerations relevant to this nascent area of research. Methods: Searches were conducted in 4 databases (PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) in February 2024. Eligible studies described the application of LLMs for suicide or self-harm prevention, detection, or management. English-language peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings were included, without date restrictions. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesize study characteristics, objectives, models, data sources, proposed clinical applications, and ethical considerations. This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) standards. Results: Of the 533 studies identified, 36 (6.8%) met the inclusion criteria. An additional 7 studies were identified through citation chaining, resulting in 43 studies for review. The studies showed a bifurcation of publication fields, with varying publication norms between computer science and mental health. While most of the studies (33/43, 77%) focused on identifying suicide risk, newer applications leveraging generative functions (eg, support, education, and training) are emerging. Social media was the most common source of LLM training data. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was the predominant model used, although generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) featured prominently in generative applications. Clinical LLM applications were reported in 60% (26/43) of the studies, often for suicide risk detection or as clinical assistance tools. Ethical considerations were reported in 33% (14/43) of the studies, with privacy, confidentiality, and consent strongly represented. Conclusions: This evolving research area, bridging computer science and mental health, demands a multidisciplinary approach. While open access models and datasets will likely shape the field of suicide prevention, documenting their limitations and potential biases is crucial. High-quality training data are essential for refining these models and mitigating unwanted biases. Policies that address ethical concerns—particularly those related to privacy and security when using social media data—are imperative. Limitations include high variability across disciplines in how LLMs and study methodology are reported. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence signals a shift in approach, particularly in applications related to care, support, and education, such as improved crisis care and gatekeeper training methods, clinician copilot models, and improved educational practices. Ongoing human oversight—through human-in-the-loop testing or expert external validation—is essential for responsible development and use. © Glenn Holmes, Biya Tang, Sunil Gupta, Svetha Venkatesh, Helen Christensen, Alexis Whitton.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study explores the role of the public service hotline 12345, a grassroots initiative in Shanghai, in capturing public sentiment and assessing the effectiveness of anti-smoking regulations. Our research aims to accurately and deeply understand the implementation and feedback of smoking control policies: by identifying high-frequency points and prominent issues in smoking control work based on the smoking control work order data received by the health hotline 12320. The results of this study will assist government enforcement agencies in improving smoking monitoring and clarify the direction for improving smoking control measures. Text-mining techniques were employed to analyze a dataset comprising 78011 call sheets, all related to tobacco control and collected from the hotline between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2019. This methodological approach aims to uncover prevalent themes and sentiments in the public discourse on smoking and its regulation, as reflected in the hotline interactions. Our study identified hotspots and the issues of greatest concern to citizens. Additionally, it provided recommendations to enforcement agencies to enhance their capabilities, optimize the allocation of human resources for smoking control monitoring, reduce enforcement costs and support for anti-smoking campaigns, thereby contributing to more effective tobacco control policies in the region. © 2024 Zhao T. et al.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Financial markets, e.g., stock markets, forex, and mercantile exchanges, etc., provide the opportunity to anyone to invest and generate finances. However, to reap maximum benefits from these financial markets, effective decision making is required to identify the trade directions, e.g., going long/short by analyzing all the influential factors, e.g., price action, economic policies, and supply/demand estimation, in a timely manner. In this regard, analysis of the financial news and Twitter posts plays a significant role to predict the future behavior of financial markets, public sentiment estimation, and systematic/idiosyncratic risk estimation. In this paper, our proposed work aims to analyze the Twitter posts and Google Finance data to predict the future behavior of the stock markets (one of the key financial markets) in a particular time frame, i.e., hourly, daily, weekly, etc., through a novel StockSentiWordNet (SSWN) model. The proposed SSWN model extends the standard opinion lexicon named SentiWordNet (SWN) through the terms specifically related to the stock markets to train extreme learning machine (ELM) and recurrent neural network (RNN) for stock price prediction. The experiments are performed on two datasets, i.e., Sentiment140 and Twitter datasets, and achieved the accuracy value of 86.06%. Findings show that our work outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with respect to overall accuracy. In future, we plan to enhance the capability of our method by adding other popular social media, e.g., Facebook and Google News etc. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The American states offer a rich place to study constitutional innovation and imitation as being among the first political bodies to adopt constitutions and also given that they often replaced them, in both cases innovating and learning from one another. In this paper, we use quantitative text analysis to identify constitutional innovation and to investigate patterns of imitation. First, we find substantial textual borrowing between state constitutions. On average, 20 percent of a state’s constitutional language was borrowed directly from another state constitution. Second, states were more likely to borrow text from geographically proximate states, from temporally proximate state constitutions, and from states that shared similar partisan profiles. Finally, we offer a brief discussion of the most influential constitutions as an exploratory example for extending our approach of identifying textual innovation and imitation. These findings offer new contributions to both the study of constitutional design and institutional diffusion. © 2021 University of Utah.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Background: Although many studies have used audio samples to predict children's language development, they have primarily focused on the frequency of language exposure rather than complex semantic relationships and the effects of context and learner variability. Method: This study examined whether children exhibit greater syntactic development when parents engage in semantically relevant conversations during mealtime and toy play, using semantic network algorithms. Additionally, it investigated gender differences in conversational topics during toy play using topic modeling and word embedding algorithms. Data from the Home-School Study of Language and Literacy Development Corpus, focusing on a subset of 62 children, were analyzed. Results: Key findings revealed the clustering coefficient for semantic networks during mealtime was positively associated with children's syntactic development. Furthermore, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and Word2Vec algorithms showed that boys and girls had different conversational focuses during toy play, with boys gravitating toward action verbs and physical activities, and girls toward social and relational themes. Implications: These findings highlight the importance of incorporating semantically relevant conversations into daily routines to support children's syntactic development. They also emphasize the need for tailored interventions that consider context and gender differences in parent–child interactions. Future research should leverage artificial intelligence (AI)-driven language processing to refine interventions, strengthen parent engagement, and inform policies that promote equitable early language learning. Conclusion: Semantically relevant conversations during mealtime significantly enhanced children's syntactic development, and gender differences in conversational content during toy play reflected distinct linguistic focuses. This study confirms and extends existing literature, suggesting that AI-driven measures could provide a more granular and nuanced understanding of children's language learning environments. © 2025 National Council on Family Relations.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

But nowadays Sri Lankan wildlife has faced many issues because of poor management and policies to protect wildlife. The lack of technical and research support leads many researchers to retreat to select wildlife as their domain of study. This study demonstrates a novel approach to data mining to find hidden keywords and automated labeling for past research work in this area. Then use those results to predict the trending topics of researches in the field of biodiversity. To model topics and extract the main keywords, the authors used the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithms. Using the topic modeling performance, an ontology model was also developed to describe the relationships between each keyword. They classified the research papers using the artificial neural network (ANN) using ontology instances to predict the future gaps for wildlife research papers. The automatic classification and labeling will lead many researchers to find their desired research papers accurately and quickly. © 2021, IGI Global.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We identified key themes regarding integrating LLMs through qualitative data analysis of verbatim responses to an open-ended questionnaire. Reviewers noted that LLMs can automate tasks such as preliminary screening, plagiarism detection, and language verification, thereby reducing workload and enhancing consistency in applying review standards. However, significant ethical concerns were raised, including potential biases, lack of transparency, and risks to privacy and confidentiality. Reviewers emphasized that LLMs should not replace human judgment but rather complement it with human oversight, which is essential to ensure the relevance and accuracy of AI-generated feedback. This study underscores the need for clear guidelines and policies, as well as their proper dissemination among researchers, to address the ethical and practical challenges of using LLMs in academic publishing. © The Author(s) 2025.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Although fathers are increasingly involved in family life, gender equality in both family and working life is still far from being achieved, and socially stressful situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic are exacerbating them. While the female burden of unpaid work within families has been widely studied in the literature, to date little is still known about fathers’ perception of their engagement in the family routine. Through the analysis of seven in-depth interviews of fathers with children aged 0-7, the present case-study investigates how and to what extent sharing parental responsibilities, i.e. childcare and household tasks, affects a variety of gender-equality related variables, such as the return to work of the partner, the fathers’ working career, and difficulties they have to address. By adopting text-mining analytical techniques, our findings suggest that, on the one hand, fathers’ higher family engagement facilitate and support the mothers’ returning to work; on the other hand, such commitment is recognised by fathers as slowing down their careers, especially in the case of self-employees. Broadly, whilst fathers recognise their parenting role and experience as a positive change compared to past generations, due to their family engagement they also point out how they have been victims of prejudices linked to gender stereotypes both at the workplace and among relatives or acquaintances. Importantly, the present study sheds (preliminary) light on the difficulties and obstacles experienced by fathers as a consequence of their closer engagement in family life-a rather unexplored aspect in literature so far. Indeed, if such behaviours will be sustained at a quantitative level as well, it might have important consequences for future gender-oriented strategies and policies, in terms of reshaping the productive system, overcoming gender stereotypes for both females and males, and mainstreaming approach to gender issues. © The Authors, 2021.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the experiences and responses of Canadians to these interventions on Twitter using the Kübler-Ross Change Curve (KRCC) during the first six months of the pandemic. Tweets were analyzed using sentiment analysis, thematic content analysis and KRCC. The findings highlight that many Canadians attempted to adapt to the changes but had a predominantly negative outlook on policies due to the financial and social repercussions. © 2023 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We investigate the use of a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to derive comprehensible driving decisions from multi-modal time-series data captured by a monocular camera on an autonomous vehicle. Leveraging a graph-of-thought structure, the LLM learns policies that perform robustly while generating natural language rationales. We generate a novel multi-modal dataset with sequential images, scene labels, and driving actions. Results demonstrate our method produces human-understandable explanations for its driving choices, providing transparency. Our work indicates incorporating language-based reasoning enables accountable and transparent decision-making for self-driving cars, making LLM a potential solution for autonomous driving. ©2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, the substantial cost on maintaining the prolonged agent interactions poses challenge over the deployment of believable LLM-based agents. Therefore, in this paper, we develop Affordable Generative Agents (AGA), a framework for enabling the generation of believable and low-cost interactions on both agent-environment and inter-agents levels. Specifically, for agent-environment interactions, we substitute repetitive LLM inferences with learned policies; while for inter-agent interactions, we model the social relationships between agents and compress auxiliary dialogue information. Extensive experiments on multiple environments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Also, we delve into the mechanisms of emergent believable behaviors lying in LLM agents, demonstrating that agents can only generate finite behaviors in fixed environments, based upon which, we understand ways to facilitate emergent interaction behaviors.

Messages from Regional Candidates on Social Media During Election Campaigns; [(Des) conexión del discurso político con la comunicación sostenible. mensajes de los candidatos autonómicos en redes sociales en campaña electoral]\n                    ABSTRACT: The main objective of this research focuses on studying the political discourse of the 75 candidates who participated in the Spanish regional elections held on May 28, 2023, in twelve autonomous communities. The aim is to determine the possible alignment or disconnection of the political agenda of these regional candidates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the UN in the 2030 Agenda. These global goals are key elements of sustainable communication and responsible leadership, as they are focused on overcoming the multiple global challenges humanity faces today. To achieve this goal, a mixed methodology was chosen, consisting of a quantitative analysis, of a descriptive nature, and a discourse analysis – qualitative method. The FanPage Karma tool allowed monitoring a total of 190 official accounts of regional candidates on Facebook, X, Instagram, and TikTok. After eliminating duplicates and selecting only those posts that explicitly mentioned the SDGs, the sample consisted of a total of n=1,523 unique messages, which were processed with MeaningCloud for sentiment analysis. The results show that most posts focus on decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and global partnerships (SDG 17). On the other hand, hunger (SDG 2), health and well-being (SDG 3), and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) are the least visible topics. The most proactive politicians in sustainable communication were Pablo Zuloaga, the PSOE candidate for the Parliament of Cantabria, and Juan Lobato, the PSOE candidate for the Assembly of Madrid. In contrast, Leticia Díaz, Vox's candidate for the Parliament of Cantabria, and Alejandra Jacinto, Podemos' candidate for the Assembly of Madrid, were the least proactive. In conclusion, although fewer than half of the messages from regional candidates mention the 2030 Agenda, sustainable messages related to governance, transparency, or social policies generate much more engagement than those related to environmental policies. © 2024, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The public attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination process should be studied carefully in order to understand the society's opinions and concerns toward it, and to take the appropriate plans by the public health authorities accordingly. The availability of accurate information during the pandemic, its reported sources and their confidentiality play a key role on the public reported opinions toward the vaccination topic. The society used the social media extensively during the pandemic and quarantine periods to track the COVID-19 news and follow the updates of the vaccines' development process. In this study, we focused on revealing the public attitudes of the COVID-19 vaccination process on twitter as a social media platform using machine learning. The tweets are collected and preprocessed for features extraction and reduction step and the K-means clustering algorithm is used to group the vaccines related tweets in order to use the Amazon Comprehend module for sentiment analysis. Most of the reported opinions that discussed the vaccines efficiency, safety, and the governments distribution plans and the policies to secure the doses for their residents were neutral. The second largest group has negative opinions according to the inaccurate information about vaccines development process, their side effects, and unsuccessful reported trials of vaccines production during different pandemic periods. Our study highlighted the urgent need for interactive communications with the society from different cultural and educational backgrounds in order to increase the vaccination awareness and validate its related news. The deliverable speech of the health care decision makers should simplify the vaccines related scientific terms, address the community concerns, and make the vaccination distribution plans publicly available for their underlying communities. © 2021 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Frequency analysis, clustering, and network analysis were performed using keywords from seven South Korean and two North Korean ICT academic journals published for five years (2015-2019). In the case of South Korea (S. Korea), the frequency of research on image processing and wireless communication was high at 16.7% and 16.3%, respectively. North Korea (N. Korea) had a high frequency of research, in the order of 18.2% for image processing, 16.9% for computer/Internet applications/security, and 16.4% for industrial technology. N. Korea’s natural language processing (NLP) sector was 11.9%, far higher than S. Korea’s 0.7 percent. Student education is a unique subject that is not clustered in S. Korea. In order to promote exchanges between the two Koreas in the ICT field, the following specific policies are proposed. Joint research will be easily possible in the image processing sector, with the highest research rate in both Koreas. Technical cooperation of medical images is required. If S. Korea’s high-quality image source is provided free of charge to N. Korea, research materials can be enriched. In the field of NLP, it calls for proposing exchanges such as holding a Korean language information conference, developing a Korean computer operating system. The field of student education encourages support for remote education contents and management know-how, as well as joint research on student remote evaluation © Jiwan Kim, Hyunkyoo Choi, Jeonghoon Mo, 2023\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Due to the importance of logistics and supply chain in the world, any disruption or mismanagement causes many problems not only in the countries directly affected but also globally. In this article, new textual data are collected from reputable commercial and news websites related to the effects of COVID-19 on logistics and supply chains. After collecting textual data, valuable information about the impact of the coronavirus is extracted using various text mining techniques performed with R programming. Finally, issues related to COVID-19 and supply chains are identified and divided into five categories: suppliers and products, governments and organisations, health, evaluation, problems, and barriers. Also, categorising the problems and limitations of supply chains and logistics will provide managerial insights to minimise obstacles and disruptions. In particular, managers should consider several suppliers to reduce dependencies and also focus on domestic suppliers because of transportation limitations. Moreover, companies should pay attention to the health of societies and employ new policies, as well as pay attention to consumer behaviour such as their tendency to buy online. © 2023 The Author(s).

With massive amount of data collected patients, personalized treatment can be provided. However, technology is a double-edge sword. Both news and media report the significant impact of security breaches, study of security is needed and as our work, life and health continually rely on more technologies, any breach or failure of the system could create disastrous impact. In this paper, we use a text analytic approach to study healthcare professionals’ view on security. Data were collected from 50 healthcare professionals with an average work experience of 17.5 years. A total of 145 posts were analyzed. The results indicate that healthcare organizations need to invest on employee training on security, developing standards in healthcare terminologies as well as security and privacy policies related to mobile and social media use. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

It is also challenging due to the strong noise generated by the news, government policies, and investor emotions. Emerging works show that the sentiment from news accumulated over weekends significantly affects stock prices. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to incorporate the sentiment from weekend news on social media to predict stock price, and then conduct a comprehensive set of popular benchmarks for comparison. Specifically, our model uses Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) and self-defined sentiment measure to extract lexical features and evaluate sentiment opinions. Then our model employs a recurrent neural network to capture potential dependency from sentiment and price-based features. Extensive experiments are implemented on stock indices and Reddit news in a high volatility period, which show that neural networks outperform all benchmarks significantly and validate the weekend effect of news on the stock market. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

These models offer unprecedented potential to swiftly disseminate critical health information and transcend linguistic barriers. However, their integration into health care systems presents formidable challenges, including inherent biases in training data, privacy vulnerabilities, and disparities in digital literacy. Despite these obstacles, LLMs possess unparalleled analytic prowess to inform evidence-based health care policies and clinical practices. Addressing these challenges necessitates the formulation of robust ethical frameworks, bias mitigation strategies, and educational initiatives to ensure equitable access to health care resources globally. By navigating these complexities with meticulous attention and foresight, LLMs stand poised to catalyze substantial advancements in global health outcomes, promoting health equity and improving population health worldwide. © 2025\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

To face this research challenge, we propose an interdisciplinary research collaboration between political and computer science. Using the show case of energy politics, we want to conduct unsupervised and semi-supervised content analysis and fusion with the help of automated text mining methods to analyze the influence of different types of so-called norm entrepreneurs on the public acceptance and, respectively, contestations of different energy policies. © 2022, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Ease of access and user friendliness make diet-tracking apps an important ally in their users’ efforts to lose and manage weight. To foster motivation for long-term use and to achieve goals, it is necessary to better understand users’ opinions and needs for dietary self-monitoring. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the key topics and issues that users highlight in their reviews of diet-tracking apps on Google Play Store. Identifying the topics that users frequently mention in their reviews of these apps, along with the user ratings for each of these apps, allowed us to identify areas where further improvement of the apps could facilitate app use, and support users’ weight loss and intake management efforts. Methods: We collected 72,084 user reviews from Google Play Store for 15 diet-tracking apps that allow users to track and count calories. After a series of text processing operations, two text-mining techniques (topic modeling and topical n-grams) were applied to the corpus of user reviews of diet-tracking apps. Results: Using the topic modeling technique, 11 separate topics were extracted from the pool of user reviews. Most of the users providing feedback were generally satisfied with the apps they use (average rating of 4.4 out of 5 for the 15 apps). Most topics referred to the positive evaluation of the apps and their functions. Negatively rated topics mostly referred to app charges and technical difficulties encountered. We identified the positive and negative topic trigrams (3-word combinations) among the most frequently mentioned topics. Usability and functionality (tracking options) of apps were rated positively on average. Negative ratings were associated with trigrams related to adding new foods, technical issues, and app charges. Conclusions: Motivating users to use an app over time could help them better achieve their nutrition goals. Although user reviews generally showed positive opinions and ratings of the apps, developers should pay more attention to users’ technical problems and inform users about expected payments, along with their refund and cancellation policies, to increase user loyalty. ©Mila Zečević, Dejan Mijatović, Mateja Kos Koklič, Vesna Žabkar, Petar Gidaković.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

For these respective countries to anticipate, respond, address, and remedy these diverse needs either by using their existing resources, or by developing new policies and initiatives, or by seeking support from other countries or international organizations dedicated to global public health, the timely identification of these needs and their associated trends is highly necessary. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a study that uses the potential of the modern Internet of Everything lifestyle, where relevant Google Search data originating from different geographic regions can be interpreted to understand the underlining region-specific user interests towards a specific topic, which further demonstrates the public health need towards the same. The scientific contributions of this study are two-fold. First, it presents an open-access dataset that consists of the user interests towards fall detection for all the 193 countries of the world studied from 2004–2021. In the dataset, the user interest data is available for each month for all these countries in this time range. Second, based on the analysis of potential and emerging research directions in the interrelated fields of Big Data, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Pattern Recognition, in the context of fall detection research, this paper presents 22 research questions that may be studied, evaluated, and investigated by researchers using this dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

The anomalies detected may be due to sudden sentiment changes hidden in large amounts of text. If these anomalies are undetected or poorly managed, the consequences may be severe, e.g. A business whose customers reveal negative sentiments and will no longer support the establishment. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide a vast source of information, which includes user feedback, opinion and information on most issues. Many organizations also leverage social media platforms to publish information about events, products, services, policies and other topics frequently. Thus, analyzing social media data to identify abnormal events in a timely manner is a beneficial topic. It will enable the businesses and government organizations to intervene early or adopt proper strategies if needed. However, it is also a challenge due to the diversity and size of social media data. In this study, we survey existing anomaly analysis as well as sentiment analysis methods and analyze their limitations and challenges. To tackle the challenges, an enhanced sentiment classification method is proposed and discussed. We study the possibility of employing the proposed method to perform anomaly detection through sentiment analysis on social media data. We tested the applicability and robustness of the method through sentiment analysis on tweet data. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method and provide meaningful insights into this research area. © 2014 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study focuses on how different platforms influence user sentiment and drive engagement. We find that emotional platform (Instagram, Twitter) fulfills the social interaction needs, leading to express their engagement. Informative platforms (YouTube and TikTok) enhance fact checking and verification, thus sentiments are less associated with engagement. The empirical results find the brain drain sentiment polarity distribution also varies with the platform categories. Based on these insights, strategic recommendations are provided for Italy to leverage social media to foster positive sentiment, encourage constructive discourse, shape the engagement, and ultimately mitigate the brain drain by attracting talent back to the country. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Most research on reelection incentives compare politicians who are term-limited with those who are not. These studies concentrate mostly on relatively senior politicians in candidate-centered electoral systems. This article leverages a quasi-natural experiment posed by the staggered implementation of the 2014 Mexican Electoral Reform, which lifted an eighty-year-old ban on reelection. The author conducts a difference-in-differences analysis of the hypothesis that reelection encourages legislators to focus more on policies with the highest electoral yield-namely, particularistic legislation. Applying a correlated topic model to a new collection of transcripts from 6,890 legislative sessions in 20 Mexican states between 2012 and 2018, this article presents compelling evidence that it does, that the effect is synchronized with the electoral cycle, and that it is larger when the legislators' political horizons are longer. © \n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, while studies have shown the importance of using green spaces during the pandemic, research is lacking on their use to treat and manage depression caused by the pandemic. Methods: This study included in-depth interviews with patients with depression and the general public regarding their use of green spaces during the pandemic, which were analyzed through text mining to suggest alternatives to address the increasing number of patients with depression during the pandemic. Results: The analysis revealed that the reasons for visiting green spaces during the pandemic were activity (exercise and socialization) and nature observation (experiencing ecological scenery); patients with depression were more interested in the activity component. Conclusion: This highlights the necessity of supplementing facilities for exercise and socialization near residential areas to treat depression. Planting of landscape crops to provide landscape resources for the general public is recommended, along with policies to prevent natural damage caused by the increased number of visitors to ecological areas. © 2024 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

There is a lot of unstructured data available but this situation makes agricultural research inefficient because of its knowledge extraction and usage failure. This problem is addressed by combining an ontology framework developed for agricultural information management with Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The solution, AA-NLP, utilizes modern NLP algorithms which extract, classify and evaluate agricultural information from many textual sources that include research papers, reports and online repositories. AA-NLP achieves effective information retrieval and exploitation through named entity identification, sentiment analysis and semantic similarity as well as other techniques to convert unstructured input into structured ontological representations. Applying AA-NLP has several benefits such as increased discoverability of relevant agricultural information, automatic classification of scientific findings, and generation of actionable insights for decision making in farming practices, crop management and formulation of agricultural policies. The effectiveness of AA-NLP was analyzed in this paper by measuring the precision associated with knowledge extraction and ontology creation through various performance metrics including accuracy, sustainability farming practices, agricultural productivity and precision.  © 2024 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Thus, social networks end up being seen as an opportunity to bend the rules, making things inadmissible in society. This work aimed to design a dictionary template for sentiment analysis applied to unethical behaviors. It also analyses how prepared the machine is for human dialogue, and proposes a hybrid approach combining existing work for dictionary creation and standard conversation recognition in the Internet.

The proposed framework aims at extracting key features of crime data available on newspaper website and classifies them into crime categories which are later transformed into a star schema for speedy retrieving and online analytical processing (OLAP). This system can present data in multidimensional structure to perform data analytics to support police officers for determining the security policies to protect locals and tourists who live in the risk areas. The main novelty of this framework is the demonstration of using information available through RSS feed service to generate reports to support decision making. The experimental results show that the extracted data from the Internet can effectively represent the actual crime data occurred in the study areas (low error rate) and allow data analysts to get an insight of the information represented through OLAP. © 2017, Walailak University.

Despite increased desalination capacity, significant sustainability concerns persist. While sustainable desalination efforts have primarily focused on improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, less attention has been paid to other environmental impacts. Moreover, questions remain about which sustainable technologies have been developed and which stakeholders’ R&D priorities. To address these gaps, we analyze patent data to trace desalination technology-development paths while examining environmental impacts and the roles of government and industry. Using bibliographical analysis, text mining, and technology life-cycle analysis, we map the evolution of the global desalination sector over the past 20 years. Our analysis reveals geographical patterns in patenting activities, including developments in core technologies such as Multiple Effect Distillation (MED), Multi-Stage Flash Distillation (MSF), and Reverse Osmosis (RO). We identify a significant misalignment between R&D pathways and broader sustainability concerns, with implications for the long-term sustainability of desalination and regional water-security policies. © 2025 The Author(s).

In this work, we looked at the development of scientific research in the field of biofuels, as a sustainable source of energy, searching for references regarding its scientific roots and social relevance. Scientific communications on biofuels published between 1998 and 2007 were analyzed using a combination of bibliometric methods and text mining techniques. This field of research was characterized as interdisciplinary, with marked social relevance. Our bibliometric analysis shows that, in this research subject, 132 different, interacting fields of knowledge overlap, with dominance of Chemistry, Engineering and Agricultural Sciences. Through the use of text mining techniques, this field was configured into three groups of Disciplinary Dimensions. The first and most influential group includes the Agricultural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Environmental Sciences. The second group, which gives the field its technological basis, includes Chemistry, Engineering, and Microbiology. The third group includes disciplines with emerging involvement in the field of biofuels: Biology and Biochemistry, Animal and Plant Sciences, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Economics, Material Sciences, Nanosciences and Nanotechnology, Geosciences, Physics, Humanities, Multidisciplinary Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Sciences. This study suggests that the first group of Disciplinary Dimensions conforms to the elements that socially validate the progress of research in the field of biofuels. This study also proposes a metric that can be used to measure the interdisciplinarity and the social framing of any other research field. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Twitter, one of the social networking sites that is expanding, serves as a platform for information, particularly in regard to ASF. Through the use of Twitter as an opinion miner, this study ascertained the attitudes of hog farmers around ASF epidemics. Using VADER Lexicon-based method as a model known for sensitivity on polarity and intensity of emotion and Orange application for ease of performing data analysis and visualization, the sentiments of the hog raisers on ASF epidemics were identified. Findings revealed that majority of hog raisers had a negative response to ASF (44.63%), 30.91% having a positive response, while 24.47% having a neutral response. Although ASF negatively affects the livelihood of hog farmers, several government actions have been put in place, and mitigation programs are currently being implemented to reduce the spread of ASF. As can be seen from the many comments offered by the sentiment analysis carried out, this is a favorable indication on the part of the government and other related agencies. Furthermore, results offered adequate insights for future consideration for the prevention of African swine fever (ASF), as well as for enhancing hog farmers' satisfaction with developmental activities and policies. © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Enhanced Event Detection Accuracy: The introduction of the SemConvTree model, which integrates improved versions of BERTopic, TSB-ARTM, and SBert-Zero-Shot, enables a significant enhancement in the detection accuracy of urban events. The model’s ability to incorporate semantic analysis along with statistical evaluations allows for discerning and categorizing events from social media data more precisely. This results in approximately a 40% increase in the F1-score for event detection compared to previous methods. Semantic Analysis for Event Identification: The SemConvTree model leverages semi-supervised learning techniques to analyze the semantic content of social media posts. This approach helps in understanding the nuanced contexts of urban events, improving the identification process. The model not only recognizes the occurrence of events but also categorizes them into meaningful groups based on their semantic characteristics, which is crucial for effective urban management and planning. What are the implications of the main findings? The increased accuracy in event detection ensures that urban planners and emergency services can respond more effectively to both planned and unplanned urban events. More accurate data leads to better resource allocation, ensuring that services are deployed where they are most needed. This could lead to enhanced safety, improved traffic management, and better crowd control during events, ultimately enhancing urban living conditions. By effectively categorizing urban events based on their semantic characteristics, city administrators can gain insights into the types of events that are prevalent in different areas of the city. This can inform more targeted community engagement strategies, help in the planning of public services and facilities, and ensure that urban policies are closely aligned with the actual dynamics of the city. Additionally, this can aid in long-term urban development strategies by identifying evolving trends and shifts in urban activity patterns. The digital world is increasingly permeating our reality, creating a significant reflection of the processes and activities occurring in smart cities. Such activities include well-known urban events, celebrations, and those with a very local character. These widespread events have a significant influence on shaping the spirit and atmosphere of urban environments. This work presents SemConvTree, an enhanced semantic version of the ConvTree algorithm. It incorporates the semantic component of data through semi-supervised learning of a topic modeling ensemble, which consists of improved models: BERTopic, TSB-ARTM, and SBert-Zero-Shot. We also present an improved event search algorithm based on both statistical evaluations and semantic analysis of posts. This algorithm allows for fine-tuning the mechanism of discovering the required entities with the specified particularity (such as a particular topic). Experimental studies were conducted within the area of New York City. They showed an improvement in the detection of posts devoted to events (about 40% higher f1-score) due to the accurate handling of events of different scales. These results suggest the long-term potential for creating a semantic platform for the analysis and monitoring of urban events in the future. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study aims to map AI-related research in libraries to identify opportunities and discuss future directions. Using textual analysis of data from Scopus, the study analyzed article titles with the burst detection algorithm and abstracts with scattertext and lemmatization. Six burst words were detected out of twelve frequently appearing in titles. Scattertext results showed a comparison between the service side (red) and the development side (blue) in libraries. Research increasingly focuses on AI utilization for library services and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance services. On the development side, AI involves product creation and encompasses AI literacy frameworks, policies, and their impact on libraries. AI affects studies in libraries by changing application methods, such as machine learning and NLP. Future research will become more diverse, considering the unique characteristics of each library. © 2025, The Author(s).\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Therefore, the cost of online civic engagement is relatively low. The level of civic engagement of Taiwanese on Internet is twice as in the real world. On the other hand, the net opinions are also a source of public opinion for the government that should pay attention to. In addition, the social network can better reflect the opinion of people which contains a lot more valuable information. In view of this, this study uses text mining technique to analyze the contents over the online community. The above data will be combined with government open data to find out the trend of the online community and the level of concerns toward government policies. In such a way the government management team will get close to public opinions. Wish to be able to provide the relevant units with results of valuable data analysis, so as to implement the development of smart city. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In this study, big data were collected and compared using NodeXL to verify differences in automotive preferences caused by differences in living standards, regional characteristics and culture, and related regulations and policies between developed and emerging countries in Asia. The data to be analyzed were collected from Twitter big data on major Asian and emerging countries and cleaned up, and text mining techniques were applied for frequency analysis. Based on this, we predicted the demand for automobiles in emerging countries in the future and derived a way for automakers to efficiently approach the automobile markets of emerging countries. The analysis results are as follows: First, emerging economies are very fond of foreign vehicles that value their confidence and pride but are more price-sensitive and prefer medium-to-small car sedans rather than SUVs. Second, pride and price should be the first marketing considerations when an automotive business enters an emerging country. Third, in emerging economies, if smalland medium-sized cars that fit lower prices are marketed mainly as sedans rather than as SUVs, local consumers will respond well. This study’s results are expected to be used as primary data for the localization sales factors necessary in understanding the car preferences of different countries for overseas marketing. © 2021\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Nevertheless, extracting potential visitors' emotional perceptions from social media and translating them into actionable recommendations for optimizing ecosystem services remains a significant challenge. The primary aim of this study is to assess and optimize the provision of ecosystem services in national parks by using social media data. A novel methodology was developed to convert unstructured social media text data into structured evaluations of ecosystem services. Moreover, by combining frequency and centrality to redefine the concept of importance, sentiment analysis was integrated to quantify visitors' emotional perceptions. Building upon this, the study introduced the Importance-performance Analysis (IPA) framework for assessing national parks ecosystem services, offering decision support for national parks planning and management. Taking Wuyishan National Park as a case study, this research demonstrated that analysis of social media text data can unveil visitors' psychological perceptions and emotional fluctuations regarding ecosystem services. Moreover, visitors exhibit diverse preferences in their perception of various ecosystem services, with Aesthetic appreciation being the most important service and inspiration, nutrient cycling, and disaster adjustment being the most satisfying. The study also revealed that the enhancement of service types such as supply of raw materials, recreation and entertainment, social inclusion, natural experiences, and sense of place and identity is urgently required. This research offers a novel perspective on the interplay between visitor perception, ecosystem services of national parks, and their management using an innovative method based on social media data. The outcomes and insights from this study can offer decision-making support for national parks policies, planning, management, as well as encourage visitor engagement in national parks development. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

It also increases the risk of life-threatening conditions as well as contributes to burden on the economy in terms of the number of days lost to productivity. Loneliness is a highly varied concept though, which is a result of multiple factors. To understand loneliness this paper carries out a comparative analysis of USA and India through Twitter data on the keywords associated with loneliness. The comparative analysis on loneliness is in the vein of comparative public health literature and to contribute to develop a global public health map on loneliness. The results showed that the dynamics of loneliness through the topics correlated vary across geographical locations. Social media data can be used to capture the dynamics of loneliness which can vary from one place to another depending on the socioeconomic and cultural norms and sociopolitical policies. © 2023 The authors and IOS Press.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

An algorithmic iterative process with N-1 steps is used to examine commuting data for the 11 subgroups and to trace LLM in both years by maximising the self-containment of jobs (number of jobs occupied by residents of the area and number of residents working in the same area) of the generated areas. Four indexes are calculated for each LLM, and the variation of these four indexes between 2001 and 2011 allows us to classify them as areas that change from areas with a surplus of jobs to deficit areas, or vice versa. The evidence indicates an increase in mobility, difference in the rates of mobility according to subgroup characteristics, and the conversion of surplus markets in employment to deficit markets. These trends give way to wider functional areas and lower levels of self-containment reflected in the length of the journey to work. This impacts quality of life, social cohesion, and the sustainability of the territories. © 2021 University of Craiova, Faculty of Social Sciences, Department of Geography.

Although the pre-trained model can conduct sentiment analysis since the beginning of a pandemic or a global emergency, this model is not optimized for a specific topic. Furthermore, the way people express opinions on the topic may quickly change during the emergency. Therefore, the early-trained model may not work consistently well during the emergency. Unfortunately, the late-trained model will not be available until months after the emergency begins. In this paper, we propose an ensemble method to combine the pre-trained model and early-trained model for achieving better analysis performance on COVID-19-related tweets. The effectiveness of this method has been verified by the experiments.  © 2020 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The noncompliance of companies with privacy policies requirements as stipulated by the various Data Protection Regulations has raised lot of concerns for users and other practitioners. To address this issue, previous research developed a model using conventional algorithms such as Neural Network (NN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to evaluate the levels of compliance of companies to general data protection regulations. However, the research performance shows to be unsatisfactory as the model’s performance across the selected core requirements of the legislation attained F1-score of between 0.52–0.71. This paper improved this model’s performance by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This was done by evaluating the same dataset used by the previous researcher to train the proposed model. The overall results show that LSTM outperform both GRU and CNN models in terms of F1-score and accuracy. This research paper is to assist the Supervisory Authority and other practitioners to better determine the state of companies’ privacy policies compliance with the relevant data protection regulations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Media framing offers interpretative package for average citizens on how to make sense of climate change and its consequences to their livelihoods, how to deal with its negative impacts, and which mitigation or adaptation policies to support. A line of related work has used bag of words and word-level features to detect frames automatically in text. Such works face limitations since standard keyword based features may not generalize well to accommodate surface variations in text when different keywords are used for similar concepts. In this paper, we develop a new type of textual features that generalize (subject,verb,object) triplets extracted from text, by clustering them into high-level concepts. We utilize these concepts as features to detect frames in text. Our corpus comprises more than 45,000 climate change related sentences. Expert coders annotated those sentences as Frame/Non-Frame and framed sentences were mapped into one of four general frame categories: Solution, problem threat, cause, and motivation. Compared to uni-gram and bi-gram based models, classification and clustering using our generalized concepts yielded better discriminating features and a higher accuracy classifier with a 12% boost (i.e. from 74% to 83% in f-measure) and 0.91 clustering purity for Frame/Non-Frame detection. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This research investigates racialised narratives in online discourse following the ban's announcement. Methods: Tweets and users responding to the April 2022 menthol ban announcement were content analysed to examine the influence of tobacco industry affiliates and potentially organic African-American/Black (AA/B) users. Next we investigated the extent to which the menthol ban was discussed on AA/B subreddits and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling to provide an overview of the menthol ban discussion on Reddit. Results: Only 28 (13.9%) tweets by 22 users claimed that the menthol ban would lead to police violence and/or racial discrimination. Of users who tweeted about over-policing, eight (36.4%) had financial connections to the tobacco industry. There were only three tweets receiving a combined seven retweets from potentially organic AA/B users. On Reddit, only two posts with one comment discussed the menthol ban on subreddits dedicated to AA/B issues and culture. Topic modelling showed that the most common topic related to the menthol ban involved the social and political implications of the ban followed by illicit markets and protecting youth. Conclusion: Tweets claiming a menthol ban will lead to police violence are indicative of industry agenda-setting. The menthol ban was not a prominent topic of discussion in AA/B subreddits although users discussing news and politics expressed concern for how AA/B people would respond to a ban politically.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

To do so, we focus on the publications of two key entities in the defense of “parental pin” in Spain: Profesionales por la Ética and Educadores contra el Adoctrinamiento. The information is collected from data mining and participant observation techniques. The analysis presents both a quantitative approach to frequencies and references, and a qualitative treatment in the form of sentiment analysis. The data show that the discourse focuses on the defense of the freedom of families to decide on the education of their children, and on the opposition to sex education as a curricular element. For this purpose, a direct attack is carried out towards the LGTBI+ collective, certain political representatives linked to the left and the public system, with a focus on the educational network, including schools and teachers. The analysis also shows the conflict between this narrative and the right to education and freedom of education, and how it has become a weapon of political and partisan pressure. Conclusions are presented and those findings are discussed with other studies in relation to hate speech and the political strategies of the extreme right and ultra-Catholicism with which our data show agreement. Finally, limitations and future proposals are pointed out. © 2024 Scientific Association Icono14.

In particular, the body positivity movement is promoting healthy body image and self-esteem through various means. This study was conducted to analyze the discourse on sustainable body image in Korean society. User-generated content from 1 January 2014 to 31 July 2023 underwent data refinement and term frequency (TF), TF–inverse document frequency (TF–IDF), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analyses. The number of blog posts in 2020 was nearly triple the number in 2019. Thus, the analysis period was divided into first (from 2014 to 2019) and second (from 2020 to 31 July 2023) periods. The TF–IDF analysis showed that shooting, photo, diet, exercise, goal, and challenge were among the top words in the first period, while Instagram-related words were mosr frequent in the second period. This finding suggested that social distancing policies significantly affected social media usage. The LDA analysis revealed five topics that were common in the first and second periods and three topics that emerged in the second period. Overall, while Western societies tend to idealize specific body types, body image discourse in Korea is centered around exercise as a means to achieve “photography” or “photo shoot”-related goals. Exercise is perceived as an activity performed for pleasure rather than attaining a particular body shape. Furthermore, there is a desire to document one’s body beautifully and maintain exercise habits in the long run. The results of this study could serve as foundational material for establishing and sustaining a positive body image culture. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

However, existing tuning techniques fall short because of the high computation and memory overhead. To this end, we introduce a computation- and memory-efficient LLM tuning framework, called Edge-LLM, to facilitate affordable and effective LLM adaptation on edge devices. Specifically, Edge-LLM features three core components: (1) a layer-wise unified compression (LUC) technique to reduce the computation overhead by generating layer-wise pruning sparsity and quantization bit-width policies, (2) an adaptive layer tuning and voting scheme to reduce the memory overhead by reducing the backpropagation depth, and (3) a complementary hardware scheduling strategy to handle the irregular computation patterns introduced by LUC and adaptive layer tuning, thereby achieving improved real hardware efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Edge-LLM achieves on-device adaptation with comparable task accuracy as vanilla tuning methods with a 2.92× speed up and a 4× reduction in memory overhead.

Traditional manual data collection methods from retail sources are labor-intensive and fraught with issues of scalability, accuracy, and data diversity. Our study introduces an OWL RDFS-based framework aligned with COICOP, and a transformer model,’PRICER’, to automate the extraction and structuring of online retail data into RDF. By iteratively fine-tuning PRICER—first with a broad DBPedia and Wikipedia knowledge base, then with specific online retail data—we achieve significant efficiency and accuracy improvements in data collection. Notably, PRICER shows marked performance gains in precision and recall after task-specific conditioning, validating our approach for converting unstructured text to structured knowledge. This advancement facilitates streamlined economic data aggregation and highlights PRICER’s adaptability for broader standardised data processing applications. Future work will focus scaling the domain specific price dataset, refining the model’s conditioning and exploring potential for other forms of technical data. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This study aims to analyse the intellectual structure of academic literature on the SDGs, Innovation, and Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). Using a database of 544 English-language publications from Scopus and Web of Science published between 2015 and 2023, we employ a three-pronged approach comprising bibliometric analyses, SDG mapping and text-mining techniques. Our findings indicate that innovations in one cluster defined in the analysis display economic, social and environmental dimensions. Furthermore, the underlying roles of innovation in the literature are found to relate to promoting sustainable development, driving economic growth, enhancing enterprise performance and strengthening policies. Within the sample literature, all 17 goals were identified by the SDG Mapper. Among the 5Ps (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnerships), there was a clear preponderance of articles on Prosperity. The text mining of titles and abstracts indicates that the term “sti” is less commonly associated with the SGDs than “innovation”. However, there is some evidence that the term “innovation” is used in titles and abstracts to attract a broader audience. Our study highlights research gaps and identifies opportunities for future studies. © 2024 The Author(s)\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

In response, the Korean Epilepsy Society initiated the Epilepsy Renaming project in 2008 to replace the stigmatizing term with a neutral and scientifically grounded name, “cerebroelectric disorder”. This study explores the impact of changing terminology on the public discourse surrounding epilepsy. Methods: Online news articles from distinct time periods (2001–2003, 2011–2014, 2017–2018, and 2020–2022) were analyzed using text data analysis techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, frequency analysis, and sentiment analysis. The inclusion of data from 2017 to 2018 allowed for an examination of discourse trends independent of the COVID-19 pandemic's influence. Correlation of words in each period was visualized via network maps. Migraine was set as control term to highlight changes in perception devoid of significant stigma intervention efforts. Results: The analysis revealed a significant shift in terminology preference, with cerebroelectric disorder gradually replacing epilepsy in news articles. The discourse surrounding epilepsy evolved over time from focusing on healthcare and economic aspects to patient-centered discussions, emphasizing the daily lives of individuals with epilepsy. This shift towards more empathetic and less stigmatized language was contrasted against the discourse on migraine, highlighting the specific impact of the terminological change on epilepsy's perception. Conclusion: The adoption of the neutral term “cerebroelectric disorder” in South Korea has influenced the discourse surrounding epilepsy, leading to more patient-centered discussions and a reduction in stigma. This study highlights the importance of terminology in shaping public perceptions of diseases and suggests that changing terminology can positively impact the understanding and destigmatization of epilepsy. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While the amount of food data increases, many important topics have been studied within separate fields or too narrow disciplines, due to the interdisciplinary nature of this type of data. The author is of the opinion that these drawbacks can be eliminated by analysing food big data using computing methods and by taking interdisciplinary approach to develop research questions. The fact that computer science has a significant role in the analysis of food consumption data is evidenced by the development of a new field of science—food computing, which is the framework of this study. Since there are still many unresolved tasks in the collection and analysis of food-related data, the use of social media and other type of big data is an important introduction. The author, by combining the methodological frameworks of cognitive, social and computer sciences, has developed several methods for using big data, based on the natural language processing and by applying the following methodologies: a) sentiment analysis of affective reactions about food and multi-sensory eating experience; b) comparative analysis of different national cuisines, by applying the topic modelling methodology; and c) bigram analysis to trace ways how food consumers talk about healthy food. Results have been summarised in a new conceptual framework by illustrating its application in practice; in the course of application, several researches, have been conducted using various computer science methodologies. As a combination of theories and methodologies of social, cognitive, and computer sciences, the new conceptual framework offers methods and a direction for studying food consumers. By using computer science methods in the analysis of big data and thus improving the understanding of food consumption, the author hopes to improve the efficiency of public health policies resulting in better public health and higher quality of life. © 2024 University of Latvia.

In this context, this study aims to analyze the similarity of syphilis online news to comprehend how public health communication interventions influence media coverage of the syphilis issue. Methods: This paper presented a computational approach to assess the effectiveness of communication actions on a public health problem. Data were collected between January 2015 and December 2019 and processed using the Hermes ecosystem, which utilizes text mining and machine learning algorithms to cluster similar content. Results: Hermes identified 1049 google-indexed web pages containing the term ’syphilis’ in Brazil. Of these, 619 were categorized as news stories. In total, 157 were grouped into clusters of at least two similar news items and a single cluster with 462 news classified as “single” for not featuring similar news items. From these, 19 clusters were identified in the pre-campaign period, 23 during the campaign, and 115 in the post-campaign. Conclusions: The findings presented in this study show that the volume of syphilis-related news reports has increased in recent years and gained popularity after the SNP started, having been boosted during the campaign and escalating even after its completion. © 2022 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This study uses a topic modeling algorithm with a text embedding technique to classify the road rage by characteristics (i.e., type, behavior, damage, punishment, and context). We collected 39 representative cases of the road rage from precedent data in Korea. We used nominalizing keywords and a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm of topic modeling among text mining techniques to analyze each case's criminal facts and punishment. After preprocessing by indexing with a coherence score, we set the appropriate number of topics. Through the study, it was confirmed that the model has the highest explanatory power with five topics. We further analyze the five topics for occurrence and subsequent road rage, method of realizing road rage, psychological state of the offenders during road rage, method of collecting evidence of road rage, and type and extent of the damage. By categorizing the keywords, we derive the road rage cases by type. Through this study, precedents dealing with criminal cases of road rage were analyzed to derive the types and causes of retaliatory driving. This result is expected to be used as basic data for the enactment of road rage policies and laws in the future. © 2022 The Authors\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

While there exist methods for hate speech detection, they stereotype words and hence suffer from inherently biased training. Bias removal has been traditionally studied for structured datasets, but we aim at bias mitigation from unstructured text data. In this paper, we make two important contributions. First, we systematically design methods to quantify the bias for any model and propose algorithms for identifying the set of words which the model stereotypes. Second, we propose novel methods leveraging knowledge-based generalizations for bias-free learning. Knowledge-based generalization provides an effective way to encode knowledge because the abstraction they provide not only generalizes content but also facilitates retraction of information from the hate speech detection classifier, thereby reducing the imbalance. We experiment with multiple knowledge generalization policies and analyze their effect on general performance and in mitigating bias. Our experiments with two real-world datasets, a Wikipedia Talk Pages dataset (WikiDetox) of size ∼96k and a Twitter dataset of size ∼24k, show that the use of knowledge-based generalizations results in better performance by forcing the classifier to learn from generalized content. Our methods utilize existing knowledge-bases and can easily be extended to other tasks. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We first construct a monthly-frequency measure of regulatory uncertainty related to oil and gas production using natural language processing on over 600,000 U.S. newspaper articles published from 1985 to 2021. We then conduct empirical analysis via structural VAR models with the constructed oil regulatory uncertainty index, oil market variables, and aggregate economic data. The impulse response functions suggest that an increase in oil regulatory uncertainty reduces oil production and drilling activity and negatively affects national and state-level economic outcomes. © 2025 Western Economic Association International.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Objectives We used unsupervised machine learning to identify and characterise sale offers of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and associated products on Instagram. We examined types of sellers, geographic ENDS location and use of age verification. Methods Our methodology was composed of three phases: data collection, topic modelling and content analysis. We used data mining approaches to query hashtags related to ENDS product use among young adults to collect Instagram posts. For topic modelling, we applied an unsupervised machine learning approach to thematically categorise and identify topic clusters associated with selling activity. Content analysis was then used to characterise offers for sale of ENDS products. Results From 70 725 posts, we identified 3331 engaged in sale of ENDS products. Posts originated from 20 different countries and were roughly split between individual (46.3%) and retail sellers (43.4%), with linked online sellers (8.8%) representing a smaller volume. ENDS products most frequently offered for sale were flavoured e-liquids (53.0%) and vaping devices (20.5%). Online sellers offering flavoured e-liquids were less likely to use age verification at point of purchase (29% vs 64%) compared with other products. Conclusions Instagram is a global venue for unregulated ENDS sales, including flavoured products, and access to websites lacking age verification. Such posts may violate Instagram’s policies and US federal and state law, necessitating more robust review and enforcement to prevent ENDS uptake and access. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

This work presents an analysis of social media comments data given in response to posts around the connection to the grid of a nuclear plant reactor in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We assessed comments on Facebook posts of local and international media, as well those written in response to a post of a social media influencer. We extracted the main themes and performed sentiment analysis. The results indicate the presence of mixed views towards nuclear energy when focusing on comments on international media’s posts as well as on the social media influencer’s post considered, whilst they were very positive when assessing comments to local media. All in all, nuclear waste and previous nuclear accidents appear to be as the top of the mind; at the same time, solar energy is often suggested in the comments as a viable energy source for the UAE. Implications for the communication of nuclear energy developments in social media are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Many practical issues and potential risks arise during the manual audit process, including a low level of efficiency, accuracy, accountability, high expense and its laborious and time consuming nature. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a continuous compliance awareness framework (CoCAF). It is defined as an AI-based automated approach to conduct procurement compliance auditing. CoCAF is used to automatically and timely audit an organisation’s purchases by intelligently understanding compliance policies and extracting the required information from purchasing evidence using text extraction technologies, automatic processing methods and a report rating system. Based on the auditing results, the CoCAF can provide a continuously updated report demonstrating the compliance level of the procurement with statistics and diagrams. The CoCAF is evaluated on a real-life procurement data set, and results show that it can process 500 purchasing pieces of evidence within five minutes and provide 95.6% auditing accuracy, demonstrating its high efficiency, quality and assurance level in procurement internal audit. © 2020 by the authors.

The Pre-Employment Cards (Kartu Prakerja) is one of the government programs that aims to provide assistance to the Indonesian people, especially those who do not have a job. Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency for 2020-2021 recipients of the pre-employment program as many as 11.4 million recipients, the pre-employment card program received responses from various communities, whether recipients or not, where these opinions included pro-contra opinions on the Pre-Employment Cards (Kartu Prakerja) program. The purpose of this study is to classify the response (sentiment) of the community by using machine learning on pre-employment cards. Sentiment analysis is used to obtain information in the form of opinions (sentiments) based on textual data to determine the public's view of news, service satisfaction, and government policies. The sentiment analysis process is divided into several stages, namely: crawling, data preprocessing, classification, and data visualization. In this study, preprocessing consists of several stages, namely: cleaning, lemmization, stemming, tokenizing, and stopword removal. The method used in this research is a combination of unsupervised learning: Lexicon Based and supervised learning: Support Vector Machine. Textual data weighting is based on data matching against the normalized Lexicon Sentiment with scaling to determine the positive, neutral, and negative sentiment classes. The results of the classification of 940 tweet data obtained 330 positive tweets (35%), 302 negative tweets (32%), and 308 neutral tweets (33%). From the test results on the classification accuracy with the Support Vector Machine, the results obtained an average accuracy of 98.75%, precision 0.98, recall 0.98, and f-measure 0.98 with the conditions for selecting the Cost value in SVM using the help of 10-fold cross validation.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

This paper analyzes the policies governing national and regional artificial intelligence infrastructures to advance an understanding of entangled narrativesin global affairs. It does so by utilizing artificial intelligence techniques that assist with generalizability and model building without sacrificing granularity. In particular, the machine learning and natural language processing big data models used alongside some process-tracing demonstrate the ways artificial intelligence infrastructural plans diverge, cluster, and transform along several topical dimensions in comparative contexts. The paper's entangled narrative approach adds to international relations (IR) theorizing about infrastructural narratives and technological diffusion. We provide patterned and granular results at various levels, which challenge and refine existing theories that attribute differences in infrastructures and technological adoption to geopolitical competition and imitation, top-down or linear international diffusion effects, and differences in political systems.  © 2025 The Author(s) (2025).

However, the heterogeneity of the constituent layers of IoT makes it vulnerable to multiple security threats. One of the typical vulnerability of IoT involves the endpoint, i.e. the apps that are used by end users for enabling IoT services. Generally, the users have to authorize the app, during installation time, to perform certain tasks. Often the apps ask for permissions to access information which are not related to the IoT services provided by them. These over-privileged apps have the chance to turn malicious at any moment and use such information for their benefit. Sometimes, the users are naive enough to trust the apps and grant permissions without caution, thus leading to unintended exposure of personal information to malicious apps. It is important to analyze the app description for understanding the exact meaning of a stated functionality in the app description. In this paper, we have focused on the use of NLP in securing user data from malicious IoT apps by analysing their privacy policies and user reviews. This is followed by a novel proposal that supports cautious decision making of users based on a careful analysis of app behaviour. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Our goal in this paper is to first analyse how sustainability is addressed at the French bachelor level; then we provide a pluralistic approach to sustainability, upon which an ambitiously effective curriculum can be built. The question is not to present a course framework - that is the professor's responsibility, but to show how pluralism can combine rigour with critical thinking within the context of sustainability.

The tweets featured information on the most common immunizations has recently been available all around the world. The method of natural language processing is the successful tool to investigate the reactions of the people to various immunizations. This paper proposes a ensemble learning model making use of the VADER lexicon, logistic regression, and random forest algorithm for sentiment analysis to understand and interpret the people's sentiments through the tweets. We utilize a collection of tweets in April to May 2021 to extract inferences about public views on vaccinations as they become more widely available during the COVID-19 pandemic. The classification output of the VADER algorithm is used as one more feature that helps to achieve better accuracy using the random forest algorithm. One more feature is added with the available features using logistic regression. Hence, the classification outputs of VADER and logistic regression improve the classification accuracy to 88% for positive-negative outputs and 84% for positive, neutral, and negative outputs.  © 2022 IEEE.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

Even world leaders need the data to make analyses and make better policies for people. In almost every field where the work process is digitized need to store data and then retrieve it. According to statistics most of the data is stored in the relational database and for manipulations of the data, Structured Query Language(SQL) is commonly used. So for handling databases a person need to have specialized knowledge regarding the queries and had to remember the syntax of many complex queries. So to enhance data manipulation using SQL and to efficiently get the required query, the paper proposes a method for the generation of SQL query from natural language input, spoken(audio input) by the user. The model is constructed on NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Neural Networks (Deep Learning) technologies. Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) Model is used for predicting queries and is trained on the dataset with natural language as input and returns outline skeletal structure of the query as output. Then the output will be processed and the final query will be displayed to the user. The project also aims to benefit the people who are suffering from Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI), causing pain in the finger joints, which has been attributed to work requiring a long period of typing and also to those who are not familiar with SQL queries. As this system will readily provide the required query. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The increasing moral consciousness of stakeholders has put pressure on companies, forcing these companies to include long-term policies that reflect the regionally specific needs of stakeholders. Using a structural topic model, this study identified differences between developing and developed countries with respect to sustainability disclosures. Data were obtained from 2100 sustainability reports published in the United Nations Global Compact database for the year 2020. In global terms, these sustainability reports addressed three main topics: 1) human rights, 2) diversity, equity, and inclusion, and 3) sustainable production. Moreover, the sustainability reports from developing and developed countries incorporated different communication strategies. Based on the prevalence (rate of occurrence) of content, sustainability reports from developed countries predominantly communicated issues related to “sustainable production” and “supply chain emissions”, whereas sustainability reports from developing countries more frequently communicated issues related to “education” and “human rights.

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

LLMs, pre-trained on vast text datasets, have exhibited exceptional abilities in understanding natural language and planning tasks. These abilities of LLMs are promising in robotics. In general, traditional supervised learning-based robot intelligence systems have a significant lack of adaptability to dynamically changing environments. However, LLMs help a robot intelligence system to improve its generalization ability in dynamic and complex real-world environments. Indeed, findings from ongoing robotics studies indicate that LLMs can significantly improve robots’ behavior planning and execution capabilities. Additionally, vision-language models (VLMs), trained on extensive visual and linguistic data for the vision question answering (VQA) problem, excel at integrating computer vision with natural language processing. VLMs can comprehend visual contexts and execute actions through natural language. They also provide descriptions of scenes in natural language. Several studies have explored the enhancement of robot intelligence using multimodal data, including object recognition and description by VLMs, along with the execution of language-driven commands integrated with visual information. This review paper thoroughly investigates how foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs have been employed to boost robot intelligence. For clarity, the research areas are categorized into five topics: reward design in reinforcement learning, low-level control, high-level planning, manipulation, and scene understanding. This review also summarizes studies that show how foundation models, such as the Eureka model for automating reward function design in reinforcement learning, RT-2 for integrating visual data, language, and robot actions in vision-language-action models, and AutoRT for generating feasible tasks and executing robot behavior policies via LLMs, have improved robot intelligence. © 2024 by the authors.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

The data originate from the 1970s and are stored in archives from the UK and US governments, plus the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The overarching theme is to analyse the involvement of the UK, the USA, and the UNHCR in different refugee cases that occurred during the 1970s. To do so, we (1) identify the main topics in each document; (2) investigate the transmission of topics horizontally (between organizations) and vertically (through time); and (3) suggest targeted areas of the document set for further close reading by historians. Standard Optical Character Recognition and object detection are used to extract information from documents and categorize them. Then, natural language processing (NLP) methods like topic modelling and clustering are used to identify topics and the relationships between them across time. The results identify several main themes covered by different organizations and how the focus of each organization changes diachronically. Besides its academic contribution, this study also demonstrates how, through the use of existing techniques with limited customization, digital technologies in the hands of the historian can augment and complement qualitative methods in bringing to light the themes and trends demonstrated in large bodies of historical documents.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The privacy policies of online websites, which serve as a legal agreement between service providers and users, are not easy for people to understand and therefore offer an opportunity for natural language processing. In this paper, we consider a corpus of these policies, and tackle the problem of aligning or grouping segments of policies based on the privacy issues they address. A dataset of pairwise judgments from humans is used to evaluate two methods, one based on clustering and another based on a hidden Markov model. Our analysis suggests a five-point gap between system and median-human levels of agreement with a consensus annotation, of which half can be closed with bag of words representations and half requires more sophistication.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}

We investigated several possibilities to support a manual process by using natural language processing, from classifying pieces of text as either argumentative or non-argumentative to clustering text fragments in the hope that these clusters would contain similar arguments. Results are diverse, but also show that we cannot come a long way without an extensive pre-tagged corpus.\n\n                    Is this abstract relevant to the policy studies community? \n\n                    ANSWER:"}]}}
